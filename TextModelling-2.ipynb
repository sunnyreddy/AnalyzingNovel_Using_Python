       "'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\\n\\nTheres a guy like me in every state and federal prison in America, I guess--Im\\nthe guy who can get it for you. Tailor made cigarettes, a bag of reefer if \\nyoure\\npartial to that, a bottle of brandy to celebrate your son or daughters high\\n\\nschool graduation, or anything else within reason, that is.  It wasnt always \\nthat way.\\n\\nI came to Shawshank when I was just twenty, and I am one of the few people in\\nour happy little family willing to own up to what he did.  I committed murder.  \\nI\\nput a large insurance policy on my wife -- who was three years older than I was \\n--\\nand then I fixed the brakes on the Chevrolet coupe her father had given us as a\\nwedding present.  It worked out exactly as I had planned -- except I hadnt \\nplanned\\n\\non her stopping to pick up the neighbor woman and the neighbor woman’s infant \\nson\\non their way down Castle Hill and into town.  The brakes let go and the car\\n\\ncrashed through the bushes at the edge of the town common, gathering speed.\\nBystanders said it must have been doing fifty or better when it hit the base of\\nthe Civil War statue and burst into flames.\\n\\nI also hadnt planned on getting caught, but caught I was.  I got a seasons \\npass\\ninto this place.  Maine has no death-penalty, but the District Attorney saw to \\nit\\nthat I was tried for all three deaths and given three life sentences, to run one\\nafter the other.  That fixed up any chance of parole I might have for a long,\\nlong time.  The judge called what I had done \"a hideous, heinous crime,\" and it\\nwas; but it is also in the past now.  You can look it up in the yellowing files\\n\\nof the Castle Rock Call, where the big headlines announcing my conviction look\\nsort of funny and antique next to the news of Hitler and Mussolini and FDRs\\nalphabet soup agencies.\\n\\nHave I rehabilitated myself, you ask?  I dont even know what that word means, \\nat\\nleast as far as prisons and corrections go.  I think its a politicians word.  \\nIt\\n\\nmay have some other meaning, and it may be that I will have a chance to find\\nout, but that is the future - something cons teach themselves not to think\\n\\nabout.  I was young, good-looking, and from the poor side of town.  I knocked \\nup a\\npretty, sulky, headstrong girl who lived in one of the fine old houses on\\n\\nCarbine Street.  Her father was agreeable to the marriage if I would take a job\\n\\nin the optical company he owned and \"work my way up.\"  I found out that what he\\nreally had in mind was keeping me in his house and under his thumb, like a\\ndisagreeable pet that has not quite been housebroken and which may bite.  Enough\\nhate eventually piled up to cause me to do what I did.  Given a second chance, I\\nwould not do it again, but Im not sure that means I am rehabilitated.\\n\\nAnyway, its not me I want to tell you about; I want to tell you about a guy\\nnamed Andy Dufresne.  But before I can tell you about Andy, I have to explain a\\nfew other things about myself.  It wont take long.\\n\\nAs I said, Ive been the guy who can get it for you here at Shawshank for damn\\nnear forty years.  And that doesnt just mean contraband items like extra\\n\\n\\ncigarettes or booze, although those items always top the list. But Ive gotten\\nthousands of other items for men doing time here, some of them perfectly legal\\nyet   hard to come by in a place where youve supposedly been brought to be\\npunished.  There was one fellow who was in for raping a little girl and exposing\\nhimself to dozens of others; I got him three pieces of pink Vermont marble and\\nhe  did three lovely sculptures out of them - a baby, a boy of about twelve, \\nand a\\n\\nbearded young man.  He called them The Three Ages of Jesus, and those pieces of\\nsculpture are now in the parlor of a man who used to be governor of this state.\\n\\nOr heres a name you may remember if you grew up north of Massachusetts-Robert\\nAlan Cote.  In 1951 he tried to rob the First Mercantile Bank of Mechanic Falls,\\nand the holdup turned into a bloodbath - six dead in the end, two of them \\nmembers\\nof the gang, three of them hostages, one of them a young state cop who put his\\nhead up at the wrong time and got a bullet in the eye.  Cote had a penny\\n\\ncollection.  Naturally they werent going to let him have it in here, but with a\\nlittle help from his mother and a middleman who used to drive a laundry truck, I\\nwas able to get it for him.  I told him, Bobby, you must be crazy, wanting to\\nhave a coin collection in a stone hotel full of thieves.  He looked at me and\\nsmiled and said, I know where to keep them.  Theyll be safe enough.  Dont you\\n\\nworry.  And he was right.  Bobby Cote died of a brain tumor in 1967, but that \\ncoin\\ncollection has never turned up.\\n\\nIve gotten men chocolates on Valentines Day; I got three of those green\\nmilkshakes they serve at McDonalds around St. Paddys Day for a crazy Irishman\\nnamed OMalley; I even arranged for a midnight showing of Deep Throat and The\\nDevil in Miss Jones for a party of twenty men who had pooled their resources to\\nrent the films . . . although I ended up doing a week in solitary for that\\n\\nlittle escapade.  Its the risk you run when youre the guy who can get it.\\n\\nIve gotten reference books and fuck-books, joke novelties like hand-buzzers and\\nitching powder, and on more than one occasion Ive seen that a long-timer has\\ngotten a pair of panties from his wife or his girlfriend . . . and I guess\\n\\nyoull know what guys in here do with such items during the long nights when\\ntime draws out like a blade.  I dont get all those things gratis, and for some\\nitems the price comes high.  But I dont do it just for the money; what good is\\n\\nmoney to me?  Im never going to own a Cadillac car or fly off to Jamaica for \\ntwo\\nweeks in February.  I do it for the same reason that a good butcher will only\\n\\nsell you fresh meat: I got a reputation and I want to keep it.  The only two\\nthings I refuse to handle are guns and heavy drugs.  I wont help anyone kill\\nhimself or anyone else.  I have enough killing on my mind to last me a \\nlifetime.\\n\\nYeah, Im a regular Neiman-Marcus.  And so when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949\\nand asked if I could smuggle Rita Hayworth into the prison for him, I said it\\n\\nwould be no problem at all.  And it wasnt.\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\nWhen Andy came to Shawshank in 1948, he was thirty years old.  He was a short,\\nneat little man with sandy hair and small, clever hands.  He wore gold-rimmed\\nspectacles.  His fingernails were always clipped, and they were always clean.\\n\\nThats a funny thing to remember about a man, I suppose, but it seems to sum\\nAndy up for me.  He always looked as if he should have been wearing a tie.  On \\nthe\\noutside he had been a vice-president in the trust department of a large Portland\\nbank.  Good work for a man as young as he was, especially when you consider how\\nconservative most banks are . . . and you have to multiply that conservatism by\\n\\nten when you get up into New England, where folks dont like to trust a man with\\ntheir money unless hes bald, limping, and constantly plucking at his pants to\\n\\nget his truss around straight.  Andy was in for murdering his wife and her \\nlover.\\n\\nAs I believe I have said, everyone in prison is an innocent man.  Oh, they read\\nthat scripture the way those holy rollers on TV read the Book of Revelation.\\nThey were the victims of judges with hearts of stone and balls to match, or\\nincompetent lawyers, or police frame-ups, or bad luck.  They read the scripture,\\nbut      you can see a different scripture in their faces.  Most cons are a low \\nsort,\\n\\nno good to themselves or anyone else, and their worst luck was that their\\nmothers carried them to term.\\n\\nIn all my years at Shawshank, there have been less than ten men whom I believed\\nwhen they told me they were innocent.  Andy Dufresne was one of them, although I\\nonly became convinced of his innocence over a period of years.  If I had been on\\nthe jury that heard his case in Portland Superior Court over six stormy weeks in\\n1947-48, I would have voted to convict, too.\\n\\nIt was one hell of a case, all right; one of those juicy ones with all the right\\nelements.  There was a beautiful girl with society connections (dead), a local\\nsports   figure (also dead), and a prominent young businessman in the dock.  \\nThere\\nwas this, plus all the scandal the newspapers could hint at.  The prosecution \\nhad\\nan open-and-shut case.  The trial only lasted as long as it did because the DA\\n\\nwas planning to run for the U.S. House of Representatives and he wanted John Q.\\nPublic to get a good long look at his resume.  It was a crackerjack legal \\ncircus,\\nwith spectators getting in line at four in the morning, despite the subzero\\ntemperatures, to assure themselves of a seat.\\n\\nThe facts of the prosecutions case that Andy never contested were these: that\\nhe had a wife, Linda Collins Dufresne; that in June of 1947 she had expressed an\\ninterest in learning the game of golf at the Falmouth Hills Country Club; that\\n\\nshe did indeed take lessons for four months; that her instructor was the\\n\\nFalmouth Hills golf pro, Glenn Quentin; that in late August of 1947 Andy learned\\nthat Quentin and his wife had become lovers; that Andy and Linda Dufresne argued\\nbitterly on the afternoon of September 10th, 1947. that the subject of their\\n\\n\\nargument was her infidelity.\\n\\nHe testified that Linda professed to be glad he knew; the sneaking around, she\\nsaid, was distressing. She told Andy that she planned to obtain a Reno divorce.\\nAndy told her he would see her in hell before he would see her in Reno. She went\\noff to spend the night with Quentin in Quentins rented bungalow not far from\\n\\nthe golf course. The next morning his cleaning woman found both of them dead in\\nbed. Each had been shot four times.\\n\\nIt was that last fact that militated more against Andy than any of the others.\\n\\nThe DA with the political aspirations made a great deal of it in his opening\\nstatement and his closing summation. Andrew Dufresne, he said, was not a wronged\\nhusband seeking a hot-blooded revenge against his cheating wife; that, the DA\\n\\nsaid, could be understood, if not condoned. But this revenge had been of a much\\ncolder type. Consider! the DA thundered at the jury. Four and four! Not six\\nshots, but eight! He had fired the gun empty . . . and then stopped to reload \\nso\\n\\nhe could shoot each of them again! FOUR FOR HIM AND FOUR FOR HER, the\\nPortland Sun blared. The Boston Register dubbed him the “Even-Steven Killer.”\\n\\nA clerk from the Wise Pawnshop in Lewiston testified that he had sold a \\nsix-shot\\n\\n.38 Police Special to Andrew Dufresne just two days before the double murder. A\\nbartender from the country club bar testified that Andy had come in around seven\\noclock on the evening of September 10th, had tossed off three straight whiskeys\\nin a twenty-minute period-when he got up from the bar-stool he told the\\nbartender that he was going up to Glenn Quentins house and he, the bartender,\\ncould \"read about the rest of it in the papers.\" Another clerk, this one from\\n\\nthe Handy-Pik store a mile or so from Quentins house, told the court that\\nDufresne had come in around quarter to nine on that same night. He purchased\\ncigarettes, three quarts of beer, and some dishtowels. The county medical\\nexaminer testified that Quentin and the Dufresne woman had been killed between\\n11:00 P.M. and 2:00 A.M. on the night of September 10th- 11th. The detective\\nfrom the Attorney Generals office who had been in charge of the case testified\\nthat there was a turnout less than seventy yards from the bungalow, and that on\\nthe afternoon of September 11th, three pieces of evidence had been removed from\\nthat turnout: first item, two empty quart bottles of Narragansett Beer (with the\\ndefendants fingerprints on them); second item, twelve cigarette ends (all\\n\\nKools, the defendants brand); third item, a plaster cast of a set of tire\\ntracks (exactly matching the tread-and-wear pattern of the tires on the\\ndefendants 1947 Plymouth).\\n\\nIn the living room of Quentins bungalow, four dishtowels had been found lying\\n\\non the sofa. There were bullet-holes through them and powder-burns on them. The\\ndetective theorized (over the agonized objections of Andys lawyer) that the\\nmurderer       had wrapped the towels around the muzzle of the murder-weapon to \\nmuffle\\nthe sound of the gunshots.\\n\\n\\nAndy Dufresne took the stand in his own defense and told his story calmly,\\ncoolly, and dispassionately. He said he had begun to hear distressing rumors\\nabout his wife and Glenn Quentin as early as the last week in July. In late\\n\\nAugust he had become distressed enough to investigate a bit. On an evening when\\nLinda was supposed to have gone shopping in Portland after her golf lesson, Andy\\nhad followed her and Quentin to Quentins two-story rented house (inevitably\\ndubbed \"the love-nest\" by the papers). He had parked in the turnout until\\n\\nQuentin drove her back to the country club where her car was parked, about three\\nhours later.\\n\\n\"Do you mean to tell this court that you followed your wife in your brand-new\\nPlymouth sedan?\" the DA asked him on cross examination.\\n\\n\"I swapped cars for the evening with a friend,\" Andy said, and this cool\\nadmission of how well-planned his investigation had been did him no good at all\\nin      the eyes of the jury.\\n\\nAfter returning the friends car and picking up his own, he had gone home. Linda\\nhad been in bed, reading a book. He asked her how her trip to Portland had been.\\nShe replied that it had been fun, but she hadnt seen anything she liked well\\nenough to buy. \"Thats when I knew for sure,\" Andy told the breathless\\nspectators.    He spoke in the same calm, remote voice in which he delivered \\nalmost\\nall         of his testimony.\\n\\n\"What was your frame of mind in the seventeen days between then and the night\\nyour wife was murdered?\" Andys lawyer asked him.\\n\\n\"I was in great distress,\" Andy said calmly, coldly. Like a man reciting a\\nshopping list he said that he had considered suicide, and had even gone so far\\nas      to purchase a gun in Lewiston on September 8th.\\n\\nHis lawyer then invited him to tell the jury what had happened after his wife\\n\\nleft to meet Glenn Quentin on the night of the murders. Andy told them . . . and\\nthe impression he made was the worst possible.\\n\\nI knew him for close to thirty years, and I can tell you he was the most\\n\\nself-possessed man Ive ever known. What was right with him hed only give you a\\nlittle at a time. What was wrong with him he kept bottled up inside. If he ever\\n\\nhad a dark night of the soul, as some writer or other has called it, you would\\nnever know. He was the type of man who, if he had decided to commit suicide,\\nwould do it without leaving a note but not until his affairs had been put neatly\\nin order. If he had cried on the witness stand, or if his voice had thickened\\n\\nand grown hesitant, even if he had started yelling at that Washington-bound\\nDistrict Attorney, I dont believe he would have gotten the life sentence he\\n\\n\\nwound up with. Even if he hadve, he would have been out on parole by 1954. But\\nhe told his story like a recording machine, seeming to say to the jury: This is\\n\\nit. Take it or leave it. They left it.\\n\\nHe said he was drunk that night, that hed been more or less drunk since August\\n24th, and that he was a man who didnt handle his liquor very well. Of course\\nthat by itself would have been hard for any jury to swallow. They just couldnt\\nsee this coldly self-possessed young man in the neat double-breasted three-piece\\nwoolen suit ever getting falling-down drunk over his wifes sleazy little affair\\nwith some small-town golf pro. I believed it because I had a chance to watch\\nAndy that those six men and six women didnt have.\\n\\nAndy Dufresne took just four drinks a year all the time I knew him. He would\\nmeet me in the exercise yard every year about a week before his birthday and\\n\\nthen again about two weeks before Christmas. On each occasion he would arrange\\nfor a bottle of Jack Daniels. He bought it the way most cons arrange to buy\\n\\ntheir stuff-the slaves wages they pay in here, plus a little of his own. Up\\n\\nuntil 1965 what you got for your time was a dime an hour. In 65 they raised it\\nall the way up to a quarter. My commission on liquor was and is ten per cent,\\nand when you add on that surcharge to the price of a fine sippin whiskey like\\nthe Black Jack, you get an idea of how many hours of Andy Dufresnes sweat in\\nthe prison laundry was going to buy his four drinks a year.\\n\\nOn the morning of his birthday, September 20th, he would have himself a big\\nknock, and then hed have another that night after lights-out. The following day\\nhed give the rest of the bottle back to me, and I would share it around. As for\\nthe other bottle, he dealt himself one drink Christmas night and another on New\\nYears Eve. Then that bottle would also come to me with instructions to pass it\\non. Four drinks a year-and that is the behavior of a man who has been bitten\\nhard by the bottle. Hard enough to draw blood.\\n\\nHe told the jury that on the night of the tenth he had been so drunk he could\\n\\nonly remember what had happened in little isolated snatches. He had gotten drunk\\nthat afternoon-\"I took on a double helping of Dutch courage\" is how he put\\n\\nit-before taking on Linda.\\n\\nAfter she left to meet Quentin, he remembered deciding to confront them. On the\\nway to Quentins bungalow, he swung into the country club for a couple of quick\\nones. He could not, he said, remember telling the bartender he could \"read about\\nthe rest of it in the papers,\" or saying anything to him at all. He remembered\\nbuying beer in the Handy-Pik, but not the dishtowels. \"Why would I want\\ndishtowels?\" he asked, and one of the papers reported that three of the lady\\njurors shuddered.\\n\\nLater, much later, he speculated to me about the clerk who had testified on the\\n\\n\\nsubject of those dishtowels, and I think its worth jotting down what he said.\\n\"Suppose that, during their canvass for witnesses,\" Andy said one day in the\\nexercise yard, \"they stumble on this fellow who sold me the beer that night. By\\nthen three days have gone by. The facts of the case have been broadsided in all\\nthe papers. Maybe they ganged up on the guy, five or six cops, plus the dick\\nfrom the Attorney Generals office, plus the DAs assistant. Memory is a pretty\\nsubjective thing, Red. They could have started out with Isnt it possible that\\n\\nhe purchased four or five dishtowels? and worked their way up from there. If\\nenough people want you to remember something, that can be a pretty powerful\\npersuader.\"\\n\\nI agreed that it could.\\n\\n\"But theres one even more powerful,\" Andy went on in that musing way of his. \"I\\nthink its at least possible that he convinced himself. It was the limelight.\\n\\nReporters asking him questions, his picture in the papers . . . all topped, of\\ncourse, by his star turn in court. Im not saying that he deliberately falsified\\nhis story, or perjured himself. I think its possible that he could have passed\\na lie detector test with flying colors, or sworn on his mothers sacred name\\nthat I bought those dishtowels. But still . . . memory is such a goddam\\nsubjective thing.\\n\\n\"I know this much: even though my own lawyer thought I had to be lying about\\nhalf my story, he never bought that business about the dishtowels. Its crazy on\\nthe face of it. I was pig-drunk, too drunk to have been thinking about muffling\\nthe gunshots. If Id done it, I just would have let them rip.\"\\n\\nHe went up to the turnout and parked there. He drank beer and smoked cigarettes.\\nHe watched the lights downstairs in Quentins place go out. He watched a single\\nlight go on upstairs . . . and fifteen minutes later he watched that one go \\nout.\\n\\nHe said he could guess the rest.\\n\\n\"Mr. Dufresne, did you then go up to Glenn Quentins house and kill the two of\\nthem?\" his lawyer thundered.\\n\\n\"No, I did not,\" Andy answered. By midnight, he said, he was sobering up. He was\\nalso feeling the first signs of a bad hangover. He decided to go home and sleep\\n\\nit off and think about the whole thing in a more adult fashion the next day. \"At\\nthat time, as I drove home, I was beginning to think that the wisest course\\nwould be to simply let her go to Reno and get her divorce.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, Mr. Dufresne.\"\\nThe DA popped up.\\n\\n\\n\"You divorced her in the quickest way you could think of, didnt you? You\\ndivorced her with a .38 revolver wrapped in dishtowels, didnt you?\"\\n\\n\"No sir, I did not,\" Andy said calmly.\\n\"And then you shot her lover.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir.\"\\n\\n\"You mean you shot Quentin first?\"\\n\\n\"I mean I didnt shoot either one of them. I drank two quarts of beer and smoked\\nhowever many cigarettes the police found at the turnout. Then I drove home and\\nwent to bed.\"\\n\\n\"You told the jury that between August twenty-fourth and September tenth you\\nwere feeling suicidal.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Suicidal enough to buy a revolver.\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Would it bother you overmuch, Mr. Dufresne, if I told you that you do not seem\\nto me to be the suicidal type?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" Andy said, \"but you dont impress me as being terribly sensitive, and I\\ndoubt very much that, if I were feeling suicidal, I would take my problem to\\nyou.\"\\n\\nThere was a slight tense titter in the courtroom at this, but it won him no\\npoints with the jury.\\n\\n\"Did you take your thirty-eight with you on the night of September tenth?\"\\n\"No; as Ive already testified-\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!\" The DA smiled sarcastically. \"You threw it into the river, didnt\\nyou? The Royal River. On the afternoon of September ninth . \"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"One day before the murders.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Thats convenient, isnt it?\"\\n\\n\"Its neither convenient nor inconvenient. Only the truth.\"\\n\\n\"I believe you heard Lieutenant Minchers testimony?\" Mincher had been in charge\\nof the party which had dragged the stretch of the Royal near Pond Road Bridge,\\nfrom which Andy had testified he had thrown the gun. The police had not found\\nit.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir. You know I heard it.\"\\n\\n\"Then you heard him tell the court that they found no gun, although they dragged\\nfor three days. That was rather convenient, too, wasnt it?\"\\n\\n\"Convenience aside, its a fact that they didnt find the gun,\" Andy responded\\ncalmly. \"But I should like to point out to both you and the jury that the Pond\\nRoad Bridge is very close to where the Royal River empties into the Bay of\\nYarmouth. The current is strong. The gun may have been carried out into the bay\\nitself.\"\\n\\n\"And so no comparison can be made between the riflings on the bullets taken from\\nthe bloodstained corpses of your wife and Mr. Glenn Quentin and the riflings on\\nthe barrel of your gun. Thats correct, isnt it, Mr. Dufresne?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. \"\\n\\n\"Thats also rather convenient, isnt it?\"\\n\\nAt that, according to the papers, Andy displayed one of the few slight emotional\\nreactions he allowed himself during the entire six-week period of the trial. A\\nslight, bitter smile crossed his face.\\n\\n\"Since I am innocent of this crime, sir, and since I am telling the truth about\\nthrowing my gun into the river the day before the crime took place, then it\\nseems to me decidedly inconvenient that the gun was never found.\"\\n\\nThe DA hammered at him for two days. He re-read the Handy-Pik clerks testimony\\nabout the dishtowels to Andy. Andy repeated that he could not recall buying\\n\\nthem, but admitted that he also couldnt remember not buying them.\\n\\nWas it true that Andy and Linda Dufresne had taken out a joint insurance policy\\nin early 1947 ? Yes, that was true. And if acquitted, wasnt it true that Andy\\nstood to gain fifty thousand dollars in benefits? True. And wasnt it true that\\n\\n\\nhe had gone up to Glenn Quentins house with murder in his heart, and wasnt it\\nalso true that he had indeed committed murder twice over? No, it was not true.\\nThen what did he think had happened, since there had been no signs of robbery?\\n\\n\"I have no way of knowing that, sir,\" Andy said quietly.\\n\\nThe case went to the jury at 1:00 P.M. on a snowy Wednesday afternoon. The\\ntwelve jurymen and -women came back in at 3:30. The bailiff said they would have\\nbeen back earlier, but they had held off in order to enjoy a nice chicken dinner\\nfrom Bentleys Restaurant at the countys expense. They found him guilty, and\\nbrother, if Maine had the death-penalty, he would have done the air dance before\\nthat springs crocuses poked their heads out of the snow.\\n\\nThe DA had asked him what he thought had happened, and Andy slipped the\\nquestion-but he did have an idea, and I got it out of him late one evening in\\n1955. It had taken those seven years for us to progress from nodding\\nacquaintances to fairly close friends- but I never felt really close to Andy\\n\\nuntil 1960 or so, and I believe I was the only one who ever did get really close\\nto him. Both being long-timers, we were in the same cellblock from beginning to\\nend, although I was halfway down the corridor from him.\\n\\n\"What do I think?\" He laughed-but there was no humor in the sound. \"I think\\nthere was a lot of bad luck floating around that night. More than could ever get\\ntogether in the same short span of time again. I think it must have been some\\nstranger, just passing through. Maybe someone who had a flat tire on that road\\nafter     I went home. Maybe a burglar. Maybe a psychopath. He killed them, \\nthats\\nall. And Im here.\"\\n\\nIII\\n\\n\\nAs simple as that. And he was condemned to spend the rest of his life in\\nShawshank - or the part of it that mattered. Five years later he began to have\\nparole hearings, and he was turned down just as regular as clockwork in spite of\\nbeing a model prisoner. Getting a pass out of Shawshank when youve got murder\\nstamped on your admittance-slip is slow work, as slow as a river eroding a rock.\\nSeven men sit on the board, two more than at most state prisons, and every one\\nof those seven has an ass as hard as the water drawn up from a mineral-spring\\nwell. You cant buy those guys, you cant sweet-talk them, you cant cry for\\n\\nthem. As far as the board in here is concerned, money dont talk, and nobody\\nwalks. There were other reasons in Andys case as well . . . but that belongs a\\nlittle further along in my story.\\n\\nThere was a trusty, name of Kendricks, who was into me for some pretty heavy\\nmoney back in the fifties, and it was four years before he got it all paid off.\\n\\nMost of the interest he paid me was information-in my line of work, youre dead\\nif you cant find ways of keeping your ear to the ground. This Kendricks, for\\ninstance, had access to records I was never going to see running a stamper down\\nin    the goddam plate-shop.\\n\\nKendricks told me that the parole board vote was 7-0 against Andy Dufresne\\nthrough 1957, 6-1 in 58, 7-0 again in 59, and 5-2 in 60. After that I dont\\nknow, but I do know that sixteen years later he was still in Cell 14 of\\n\\nCellblock 5. By then – 1975 - he was fifty-seven. They probably would have \\ngotten\\nbig-hearted and let him out around 1983. They give you life, and thats what\\n\\nthey take-all of it that counts, anyway. Maybe they set you loose someday, but \\n.\\n\\n. . ..\\n\\nWell, listen: I knew this guy, Sherwood Bolton, his name was, and he had\\nthis pigeon in his cell. From 1945 until 1953, when they let him out, he had\\nthat pigeon. He wasnt any Birdman of Alcatraz; he just had this pigeon. Jake,\\n\\nhe called him. He set Jake free a day before he, Sherwood, that is, was to walk,\\nand Jake flew away just as pretty as you could want. But about a week after\\nSherwood Bolton left our happy little family, a friend of mine called me over to\\nthe  west corner of the exercise yard, where Sherwood used to hang out. A bird\\nwas lying there like a very small pile of dirty bed-linen. It looked starved. My\\nfriend said: \"Isnt that Jake, Red?\" It was. That pigeon was just as dead as a\\nturd.\\n\\nI remember the first time Andy Dufresne got in touch with me for something; I\\nremember like it was yesterday. That wasnt the time he wanted Rita Hayworth,\\nthough. That came later. In that summer of 1948 he came around for something\\nelse.\\n\\nMost of my deals are done right there in the exercise yard, and thats where\\n\\n\\nthis one went down. Our yard is big, much bigger than most Its a perfect\\nsquare, ninety yards on a side. The north side is the outer wall, with a\\n\\nguard-tower at either end. The guards up there are armed with binoculars and\\nriot guns. The main gate is in that north side. The truck loading-bays are on\\nthe south side of the yard. There are five of them. Shawshank is a busy place\\nduring the work week-deliveries in, deliveries out. We have the license-plate\\nfactory, and a big industrial laundry that does all the prison wet-wash, plus \\nthat\\nof Kittery Receiving Hospital and the Eliot Nursing Home. Theres also a big\\nautomotive garage where mechanic inmates fix prison, state, and municipal\\n\\nvehicles-not to mention the private cars of the screws, the administration \\nofficers . . .\\nand, on more than one occasion, those of the parole board.\\n\\nThe east side is a thick stone wall full of tiny slit windows. Cellblock 5 is on\\nthe other side of that wall. The west side is Administration and the infirmary.\\n\\nShawshank has never been as overcrowded as most prisons, and back in 48 it was\\nonly filled to something like two-thirds capacity, but at any given time there\\n\\nmight be eighty to a hundred and twenty cons on the yard- playing toss with a\\nfootball or a baseball, shooting craps, jawing at each other, making deals. On\\nSunday    the place was even more crowded; on Sunday the place would have looked\\nlike  a country holiday . . . if there had been any women.\\n\\nIt was on a Sunday that Andy first came to me. I had just finished talking to\\n\\nElmore Armitage, a fellow who often came in handy to me, about a radio when Andy\\nwalked up. I knew who he was, of course; he had a reputation for being a snob\\n\\nand a cold fish. People were saying he was marked for trouble already. One of\\n\\nthe people saying so was Bogs Diamond, a bad man to have on your case. Andy had\\nno cellmate, and Id heard that was just the way he wanted it, although people\\n\\nwere already saying he thought his shit smelled sweeter than the ordinary. But I\\ndont have to listen to rumors about a man when I can judge him for myself.\\n\"Hello,\" he said. \"Im Andy Dufresne.\" He offered his hand and I shook it. He\\nwasnt a man to waste time being social; he got right to the point. \"I\\n\\nunderstand that youre a man who knows how to get things . \"\\n\\nI agreed that I was able to locate certain items from time to time.\\n\"How do you do that?\" Andy asked.\\n\\n\"Sometimes,\" I said, \"things just seem to come into my hand. I cant explain it.\\nUnless its because Im Irish.\"\\n\\nHe smiled a little at that. \"I wonder if you could get me a rock hammer. \"\\n\"What would that be, and why would you want it?\"\\n\\nAndy looked surprised. \"Do you make motivations a part of your business?\" With\\n\\n\\nwords like those I could understand how he had gotten a reputation for being the\\nsnobby sort, the kind of guy who likes to put on airs-but I sensed a tiny \\nthread\\n\\nof humor in his question.\\n\\n\"Ill tell you,\" I said. \"If you wanted a toothbrush, I wouldnt ask questions.\\n\\nId just quote you a price. Because a toothbrush, you see, is a non-lethal sort\\nof an object.\"\\n\\n\"You have strong feelings about lethal objects?\"\\n\"I do.\"\\n\\nAn old friction-taped baseball flew toward us and he turned, cat-quick, and\\npicked it out of the air. It was a move Frank Malzone would have been proud of.\\n\\nAndy flicked the ball back to where it had come from-just a quick and\\n\\neasy-looking flick of the wrist, but that throw had some mustard on it, just the\\nsame. I could see a lot of people were watching us with one eye as they went\\nabout their business. Probably the guards in the tower were watching, too. I\\nwont gild the lily; there are cons that swing weight in any prison, maybe four\\nor five in a small one, maybe two or three dozen in a big one. At Shawshank I\\n\\nwas one of those with some weight, and what I thought of Andy Dufresne would\\nhave a lot to do with how his time went. He probably knew it, too, but he wasnt\\nkowtowing or sucking up to me, and I respected him for that.\\n\\n\"Fair enough. Ill tell you what it is and why I want it. A rock hammer looks\\nlike a miniature pickaxe-about so long.\" He held his hands about a foot apart,\\nand that was when I first noticed how neatly kept his nails were. \"Its got a\\nsmall sharp pick on one end and a flat, blunt hammerhead on the other. I want it\\nbecause I like rocks.\"\\n\\n\"Rocks, \" I said.\\n\\n\"Squat down here a minute,\" he said.\\n\\nI humored him. We hunkered down on our haunches like Indians.\\n\\nAndy took a handful of exercise yard dirt and began to sift it between his neat\\nhands, so it emerged in a fine cloud. Small pebbles were left over, one or two\\nsparkly, the rest dull and plain. One of the dull ones was quartz, but it was\\nonly dull until youd rubbed it clean. Then it had a nice milky glow. Andy did\\nthe cleaning and then tossed it to me. I caught it and named it.\\n\\n\"Quartz, sure,\" he said. \"And look. Mica. Shale. Silted granite. Heres a place\\nof graded limestone, from when they cut this place out of the side of the \\nhill.\"\\n\\nHe tossed them away and dusted his hands. \"Im a rockhound. At least . . . I \\nwas\\n\\n\\na rockhound. In my old life. Id like to be one again, on a limited scale.\"\\n\\n\"Sunday expeditions in the exercise yard?\" I asked, standing up. It was a silly\\nidea, and yet . . . seeing that little piece of quartz had given my heart a\\n\\nfunny tweak. I dont know exactly why; just an association with the outside\\nworld, I suppose. You didnt think of such things in terms of the yard. Quartz\\nwas something you picked out of a small, quick-running stream.\\n\\n\"Better to have Sunday expeditions here than no Sunday expeditions at all,\" he\\nsaid.\\n\\n\"You could plant an item like that rock-hammer in somebodys skull,\" I remarked.\\n\"I have no enemies here,\" he said quietly.\\n\\n\"No?\" I smiled. \"Wait awhile.\"\\n\\n\"If theres trouble, I can handle it without using a rock hammer. \"\\n\\n\"Maybe you want to try an escape? Going under the wall? Because if you do-\"\\n\\nHe laughed politely. When I saw the rock-hammer three weeks later, I understood\\nwhy.\\n\\n\"You know,\" I said, \"if anyone sees you with it, theyll take it away. If they\\nsaw you with a spoon, theyd take it away. What are you going to do, just sit\\ndown here in the yard and start bangin away?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I believe I can do a lot better than that.\"\\n\\nI nodded. That part of it really wasnt my business, anyway. A man engages my\\nservices to get him something. Whether he can keep it or not after I get it is\\n\\nhis business.\\n\\n\"How much would an item like that go for?\" I asked. I was beginning to enjoy his\\nquiet, low-key style. When youve spent ten years in stir, as I had then, you\\n\\ncan get awfully tired of the bellowers and the braggarts and the loud-mouths.\\nYes, I think it would be fair to say I liked Andy from the first.\\n\\n\"Eight dollars in any rock-and-gem shop,\" he said, \"but I realize that in a\\nbusiness like yours you work on a cost-plus basis-\"\\n\\n\"Cost plus ten per cent is my going rate, but I have to go up some on a \\ndangerous\\nitem. For something like the gadget youre talking about, it takes a little more\\ngoose-grease to get the wheel turning. Lets say ten dollars.\\n\\n\\n\"Ten it is.\"\\n\\nI looked at him, smiling a little. \"Have you got ten dollars?\"\\n\"I do,\" he said quietly.\\n\\nA long time after, I discovered that he had better than five hundred. He had\\nbrought it in with him. When they check you at this hotel, one of the bellhops\\nis obliged to bend you over ant take a look up your works-but there are a lot of\\nworks, and, not to put too fine a point on it, a man who is really determined\\ncan get; fairly large item quite a ways up them-far enough to be out o sight,\\nunless the bellhop you happen to draw is in the mood to pull on a rubber glove\\nand go prospecting.\\n\\n\"Thats fine, \" I said. \"You ought to know what I expect if you get caught with\\nwhat I get you.\"\\n\\n\"I suppose I should,\" he said, and I could tell by the slight change in his gray\\neyes that he knew exactly what I was going to say. It was a slight lightening, a\\ngleam of his special ironic humor\\n\\n\"If you get caught, youll say you found it. Thats about the long and short of\\nit. Theyll put you in solitary for three or you weeks . . . plus, of course,\\n\\nyoull lose your toy and youll get black mark on your record. If you give them\\nmy name, you and will never do business again. Not for so much as a pair of\\nshoelace or a bag of Bugler. And Ill send some fellows around to lump you up. I\\ndont like violence, but youll understand my position. I can allow it to get\\naround that I cant handle myself. That would sure finish me.\"\\n\\n\"Yes. I suppose it would. I understand, and you dont need to worry. \"\\n\"I never worry,\" I said. \"In a place like this theres no percentage in it.\"\\n\\nHe nodded and walked away. Three days later he walked u] beside me in the\\nexercise yard during the laundrys morning break He didnt speak or even look my\\nway, but pressed a picture of the Honorable Alexander Hamilton into my hand\\n\\nas neatly as a good magician does a card-trick. He was a man who adapted fast.\\n\\nI got him his rock-hammer. I had it in my cell for one night, and it was just \\nas he described\\nit. It was no tool for escape (it would have taken a man just about six hundred \\nyears to\\ntunnel under the wall using that rock-hammer, I figured), but I still felt some \\nmisgivings. If\\nyou planted that pickaxe end in a mans head, he would surely never\\n\\nlisten to Fibber McGee and Molly on the radio again. And Andy had already begun \\nhaving\\ntrouble with the sisters. I hoped it wasnt them he was wanting the rock-\\n\\nhammer for.\\n\\n\\nIn the end, I trusted my judgment. Early the next morning, twenty minutes before\\nthe wake-up horn went off, I slipped the rock-hammer and a package of Camels to\\nErnie, the old trusty who swept the Cellblock 5 corridors until he was let free\\n\\nin 1956. He slipped it into his tunic without a word, and I didnt see the\\n\\nrock hammer again for nineteen years, and by then it was damned near worn away \\nto\\nnothing.\\n\\nThe following Sunday Andy walked over to me in the exercise yard again. He was\\nnothing to look at that day, I can tell you. His lower lip was swelled up so \\nbig\\n\\nit looked like a summer sausage, his right eye was swollen half-shut, and there\\nwas an ugly washboard scrape across one cheek. He was having his troubles with\\nthe sisters, all right, but he never mentioned them. \"Thanks for the tool,\" he\\n\\nsaid, and walked away.\\n\\nI watched him curiously. He walked a few steps, saw something in the dirt, bent\\nover, and picked it up. It was a small rock. Prison fatigues, except for those\\nworn  by mechanics when theyre on the job, have no pockets. But there are ways\\nto get around that. The little pebble disappeared up Andys sleeve and didnt\\ncome down. I admired that . . . and I admired him. In spite of the problems he\\nwas having, he was going on with his life. There are thousands who dont or\\nwont or cant, and plenty of them arent in prison, either. And I noticed that,\\nalthough his face looked as if a twister had happened to it, his hands were\\n\\nstill neat and clean, the nails well-kept.\\n\\nI didnt see much of him over the next six months; Andy spent a lot of that time\\nin solitary.\\n\\nIV\\n\\n\\nA few words about the sisters.\\n\\nIn a lot of pens they are known as bull queers or jailhouse susies-just lately\\nthe term in fashion is \"killer queens.\" But in Shawshank they were always the\\nsisters. I dont know why, but other than the name I guess there was no\\ndifference.\\n\\nIt comes as no surprise to most these days that theres a lot of buggery going\\non inside the walls-except to some of the new fish, maybe, who have the\\n\\nmisfortune to be young, slim, good-looking, and unwary-but homosexuality, like\\nstraight sex, comes in a hundred different shapes and forms. There are men who\\ncant stand to be without sex of some kind and turn to another man to keep from\\ngoing crazy. Usually what follows is an arrangement between two fundamentally\\nheterosexual men, although Ive sometimes wondered if they are quite as\\nheterosexual as they thought they were going to be when they get back to their\\nwives or their girlfriends.\\n\\nThere are also men who get \"turned\" in prison. In the current parlance they \"go\\ngay,\" or \"come out of the closet. \" Mostly (but not always) they play the\\nfemale, and their favors are competed for fiercely.\\n\\nAnd then there are the sisters.\\n\\nThey are to prison society what the rapist is to the society outside the walls.\\nTheyre usually long-timers, doing hard bullets for brutal crimes. Their prey is\\nthe young, the weak, and the inexperienced . . . or, as in the case of Andy\\n\\nDufresne, the weak-looking. Their hunting grounds are the showers, the cramped,\\ntunnel-like areaway behind the industrial washers in the laundry, sometimes the\\ninfirmary. On more than one occasion rape has occurred in the closet-sized\\nprojection booth behind the auditorium. Most often what the sisters take by\\n\\nforce they could have had for free, if they wanted it that way; those who have\\nbeen turned always seem to have \"crushes\" on one sister or another, like teenage\\ngirls with their Sinatras, Presleys, or Redfords. But for the sisters, the joy\\n\\nhas always been in taking it by force . . . and I guess it always will be.\\n\\nBecause of his small size and fair good looks (and maybe also because of that\\nvery quality of self-possession I had admired), the sisters were after Andy from\\nthe day he walked in. If this was some kind of fairy story, Id tell you that\\nAndy fought the good fight until they left him alone. I wish I could say that,\\nbut     I cant. Prison is no fairy-tale world.\\n\\nThe first time for him was in the shower less than three days after he joined\\nour happy Shawshank family. Just a lot of slap and tickle that time, I\\nunderstand. They like to size you up before they make their real move, like\\n\\n\\njackals finding out if the prey is as weak and hamstrung as it looks.\\n\\nAndy punched back and bloodied the lip of a big, hulking sister named Bogs\\nDiamond-gone these many years since to who knows where. A guard broke it up\\nbefore it could go any further, but Bogs promised to get him-and Bogs did.\\n\\nThe second time was behind the washers in the laundry. A lot has gone on in that\\nlong, dusty, and narrow space over the years; the guards know about it and just\\nlet it be. Its dim and littered with bags of washing and bleaching compound,\\ndrums of Hexlite catalyst, as harmless as salt if your hands are dry, murderous\\n\\nas battery acid if theyre wet. The guards dont like to go back there. Theres\\n\\nno room to maneuver, and one of the first things they teach them when they come\\nto work in a place like this is to never let the cons get you in a place where\\n\\nyou cant back up.\\n\\nBogs wasnt there that day, but Henley Backus, who had been washroom foreman\\ndown there since 1922, told me that four of his friends were. Andy held them at\\n\\nbay for awhile with a scoop of burning Hexlite, threatening to throw it in \\ntheir eyes if\\nthey came any closer, but he tripped trying to back around one of the big Washex\\nfourpockets. That was all it took. They were on him.\\n\\nI guess the phrase gang-rape is one that doesnt change much from one generation\\nto the next. Thats what they did to him, those four sisters. They bent him \\nover\\n\\na gear-box and one of them held a Phillips screwdriver to his temple while they\\ngave him the business. It rips you up some, but not bad-am I speaking from\\npersonal experience, you ask?-I only wish I werent. You bleed for awhile. If\\n\\nyou dont want some clown asking you if you just started your period, you wad up\\na bunch of toilet paper and keep it down the back of your underwear until it\\n\\nstops. The bleeding really is like a menstrual flow; it keeps up for two, maybe\\nthree days, a slow trickle. Then it stops. No harm done, unless theyve done\\nsomething even more unnatural to you. No physical harm done but rape is rape,\\nand eventually you have to look at your face in the mirror again and decide what\\nto make of yourself.\\n\\nAndy went through that alone, the way he went through everything alone in those\\ndays. He must have come to the conclusion that others before him had come to,\\nnamely, that then are only two ways to deal with the sisters: fight them and get\\ntaken   or just get taken.\\n\\nHe decided to fight. When Bogs and two of his buddies cam after him a week or so\\nafter the laundry incident (\"I heard ya go broke in,\" Bogs said, according to\\n\\nErnie, who was around at the time), Andy slugged it out with them. He broke the\\nnose of fellow named Rooster MacBride, a heavy-gutted farmer who was is for\\nbeating his stepdaughter to death. Rooster died in here, Im happy to add.\\n\\nThey took him, all three of them. When it was done, Rooster and the other \\negg-it\\n\\n\\nmight have been Pete Verness, but Im no completely sure-forced Andy down to his\\nknees. Bogs Diamond stepped in front of him. He had a pearl-handled razor in\\nthose day with the words Diamond Pearl engraved on both sides of the grip He\\nopened it and said, \"Im gonna open my fly now, mister man and youre going to\\nswallow what I give you to swallow. And when you done swallowed mine, youre\\ngonna swallow Roosters. I guess you done broke his nose and I think he ought to\\nhave something to pay for it.\"\\n\\nAndy said, \"Anything of yours that you stick in my mouth youre going to lose\\nit.\"\\n\\nBogs looked at Andy like he was crazy, Ernie said.\\n\\n\"No,\" he told Andy, talking to him slowly, like Andy was stupid kid. \"You didnt\\nunderstand what I said. You do anything like that and Ill put all eight inches\\n\\nof this steel into your ear. Get it?\"\\n\\n\"I understood what you said. I dont think you understood me. Im going to bite\\nwhatever you stick into my mouth. You can put that razor into my brain, I guess,\\nbut you should know that sudden serious brain injury causes the victim to\\nsimultaneously urinate, defecate . . . and bite down.\"\\n\\nHe looked up at Bogs, smiling that little smile of his, old Ernie said, as if\\nthe three of them had been discussing stocks and bonds with him instead of\\n\\nthrowing it to him just as hard as they could. Just as if he was wearing one of\\nhis three-piece bankers suits instead of kneeling on a dirty broom-closet floor\\nwith his pants around his ankles and blood trickling down the insides of his\\nthighs.\\n\\n\"In fact,\" he went on, \"I understand that the bite-reflex is sometimes so strong\\nthat the victims jaws have to be pried open with a crowbar or a jackhandle.\"\\nBogs didnt put anything in Andys mouth that night in late February of 1948,\\nand neither did Rooster MacBride, and so far as I know, no one else ever did,\\neither. What the three of them did was to beat Andy within an inch of his life,\\nand all four of them ended up doing a jolt in solitary. Andy and Rooster\\nMacBride went by way of the infirmary.\\n\\nHow many times did that particular crew have at him? I dont know. I think\\nRooster lost his taste fairly early on -- being in nosesplints for a month can \\ndo\\nthat to a fellow -- and Bogs Diamond left off that summer, all at once.\\n\\nThat was a strange thing. Bogs was found in his cell, badly beaten, one morning\\nin early June, when he didnt show up in the breakfast nose-count. He wouldnt\\nsay who had done it, or how they had gotten to him, but being in my business, I\\nknow that a screw can be bribed to do almost anything except get a gun for an\\n\\n\\ninmate. They didnt make big salaries then, and they dont now. And in those\\ndays there was no electronic locking system, no closed-circuit TV, no\\n\\nmaster-switches which controlled whole areas of the prison. Back in 1948, each\\ncellblock had its own turnkey. A guard could have been bribed real easy to let\\nsomeone-maybe two or three someones-into the block, and, yes, even into\\nDiamonds cell.\\n\\nOf course a job like that would have cost a lot of money. Not by outside\\nstandards, no. Prison economics are on a smaller scale. When youve been in here\\nawhile, a dollar bill in your hand looks like a twenty did outside. My guess is\\nthat,       if Bogs was done, it cost someone a serious piece of change-fifteen \\nbucks,\\nwell say, for the turnkey, and two or three apiece for each of the lump-up\\n\\nguys.\\n\\nIm not saying it was Andy Dufresne, but I do know that he brought in five\\nhundred dollars when he came, and he was a banker in the straight world-a man\\nwho understands better than the rest of us the ways in which money can become\\npower.\\n\\nAnd I know this: after the beating-the three broken ribs, the hemorrhaged eye,\\nthe sprained back, and the dislocated hip-Bogs Diamond left Andy alone. In fact,\\nafter that he left everyone pretty much alone. He got to be like a high wind in\\nthe summertime, all bluster and no bite. You could say, in fact, that he turned\\ninto a \"weak sister.\"\\n\\nThat was the end of Bogs Diamond, a man who might eventually have killed Andy if\\nAndy hadnt taken steps to prevent it (if it was him who took the steps). But it\\nwasnt the end of Andys trouble with the sisters. There was a little hiatus,\\n\\nand then it began again, although not so hard or so often. Jackals like easy\\nprey, and there were easier pickings around than Andy Dufresne.\\n\\nHe always fought them, thats what I remember. He knew, I guess, that if you let\\nthem have at you even once without fighting, it got that much easier to let them\\nhave their way without fighting next time. So Andy would turn up with bruises on\\nhis face every once in awhile, and there was the matter of the two broken\\n\\nfingers six or eight months after Diamonds beating. Oh yes-and sometime in late\\n1949, the man landed in the infirmary with a broken cheekbone that was probably\\nthe result of someone swinging a nice chunk of pipe with the business-end\\nwrapped in flannel. He always fought back, and as a result, he did his time in\\nsolitary. But I dont think solitary was the hardship for Andy that it was for\\n\\nsome men. He got along with himself.\\n\\nThe sisters was something he adjusted himself to-and then, in 1950, it stopped\\nalmost completely. That is a part of my story that Ill get to in due time.\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\nIn the fall of 1948, Andy met me one morning in the exercise yard and asked me\\nif I could get him half a dozen rock-blankets.\\n\\n\"What the hell are those?\" I asked.\\n\\nHe told me that was just what rockhounds called them; they were polishing cloths\\nabout the size of dishtowels. They were heavily padded, with a smooth side and a\\nrough side-the smooth side like fine-grained sandpaper, the rough side almost as\\nabrasive as industrial steel wool (Andy also kept a box of that in his cell,\\n\\nalthough he didnt get it from me-I imagine he kited it from the prison\\nlaundry).\\n\\nI told him I thought we could do business on those, and I ended up getting them\\nfrom the very same rock-and-gem shop where Id arranged to get the rock-hammer.\\n\\nThis time I charged Andy my usual ten per cent and not a penny more. I didnt\\nsee anything lethal or even dangerous in a dozen 7\" x 7\" squares of padded\\ncloth. Rock-blankets, indeed.\\n\\nIt was about five months later that Andy asked if I could get him Rita Hayworth.\\nThat conversation took place in the auditorium, during a movie-show. Nowadays we\\nget the movie-shows once or twice a week, but back then the shows were a monthly\\nevent. Usually the movies we got had a morally uplifting message to them, and\\n\\nthis one, The Lost Weekend, was no different. The moral was that its dangerous\\nto drink. It was a moral we could take some comfort in.\\n\\nAndy maneuvered to get next to me, and about halfway through the show he leaned\\na little closer and asked if I could get him Rita Hayworth. Ill tell you the\\n\\ntruth, it kind of tickled me. He was usually cool, calm, and collected, but that\\nnight he was jumpy as hell, almost embarrassed, as if he was asking me to get\\nhim  a load of Trojans or one of those sheepskin-lined gadgets that are supposed\\nto \"enhance your solitary pleasure,\" as the magazines put it. He seemed\\novercharged, a man on the verge of blowing his radiator.\\n\\n\"I can get her,\" I said. \"No sweat, calm down. You want the big one or the\\nlittle one?\" At that time Rita was my best girl (a few years before it had been\\nBetty Grable) and she came in two sizes. For a buck you could get the little\\nRita. For two-fifty you could have the big Rita, four feet high and all woman.\\n\"The big one,\" he said, not looking at me. I tell you, he was a hot sketch that\\n\\n\\nnight. He was blushing just like a kid trying to get into a kootch show with his\\nbig brothers draft-card. \"Can you do it?\"\\n\\n\"Take it easy, sure I can. Does a bear shit in the woods?\" The audience was\\napplauding and catcalling as the bugs came out of the walls to get Ray Milland,\\nwho was having a bad case of the DTs\\n\\n\"How soon?\"\\n\\n\"A week. Maybe less.\"\\n\\n\"Okay. \" But he sounded disappointed, as if he had been hoping had one stuffed\\ndown my pants right then. \"How much?\"\\n\\nI quoted him the wholesale price. I could afford to give him this one at cost;\\nhed been a good customer, what with his rock-hammer and his rock-blankets.\\n\\nFurthermore, hed been a good boy-o more than one night when he was having his\\nproblems with Bogs Rooster, and the rest, I wondered how long it would be before\\nh used the rock-hammer to crack someones head open.\\n\\nPosters are a big part of my business, just behind the booze an, cigarettes,\\nusually half a step ahead of the reefer. In the sixties the business exploded in\\nevery direction, with a lot of people wanting funky hang-ups like Jimi Hendrix,\\nBob Dylan, that Easy Rider poster. But mostly its girls; one pin-up queen after\\nanother.\\n\\nA few days after Andy spoke to me, a laundry driver I did business with back\\nthen brought in better than sixty posters, most of them Rita Hayworths. You may\\neven remember the picture; sure do. Rita is dressed-sort of-in a bathing suit,\\n\\none hand behind her head, her eyes half-closed, those full, sulky red lips\\nparted. They called it Rita Hayworth, but they might as well have called it\\nWoman in Heat.\\n\\nThe prison administration knows about the black market, in case you were\\nwondering. Sure they do. They probably know almost much about my business as I\\ndo myself. They live with it because they know that a prison is like a big\\n\\npressure-cooker, and there has to be vents somewhere to let off steam. They make\\nthe occasion; bust, and Ive done time in solitary a time or three over the \\nyear\\n\\nbut when its something like posters, they wink. Live and let live And when a\\nbig Rita Hayworth went up in some fishies cell, the assumption was that it came\\nin the mail from a friend or a relative. Of course all the care-packages from\\n\\nfriends and relatives are opened and the contents inventoried, but who goes back\\nand rechecks the inventory sheets for something as harmless as a Rita Hayworth\\nor Ava Gardner pin-up? When youre in a pressure cooker you learn to live and \\nlet\\nlive or somebody will carve you a brand-new mouth just above the Adams apple.\\n\\n\\nYou learn to make allowances.\\n\\nIt was Ernie again who took the poster up to Andys cell, 14, from my own, 6.\\nAnd it was Ernie who brought back the note, written in Andys careful hand, just\\none word: \"Thanks.\"\\n\\nA little while later, as they filed us out for morning chow, I glanced into his\\n\\ncell and saw Rita over his bunk in all her swimsuited glory, one hand behind her\\nhead, her eyes half-closed, those soft, satiny lips parted. It was over his bunk\\nwhere he could look at her nights, after lights-out, in the glow of the arc\\nsodium lights in the exercise yard.\\n\\nBut in the bright morning sunlight, there were dark slashes across her face-the\\nshadow of the bars on his single slit window.\\n\\n\\nVI\\n\\nNow Im going to tell you what happened in mid-May of 1950 that finally ended\\nAndys three-year series of skirmishes with the sisters. It was also the\\n\\nincident which eventually got him out of the laundry and into the library, where\\nhe filled out his work-time until he left our happy little family earlier this\\n\\nyear.\\n\\nYou may have noticed how much of what Ive told you already is hearsay-someone\\nsaw something and told me and I told you. Well, in some cases Ive simplified it\\neven more than it really was, and have repeated (or will repeat) fourth- or\\n\\nfifth-hand information. Thats the way it is here. The grapevine is very real,\\nand you have to use it if youre going to stay ahead. Also, of course, you have\\nto know how to pick out the grains of truth from the chaff of lies, rumors, and\\nwish-it-had-beens.\\n\\nYou may also have gotten the idea that Im describing someone whos more legend\\nthan man, and I would have to agree that theres some truth to that. To us\\n\\nlong-timers who knew Andy over a space of years, there was an element of fantasy\\nto him, a sense, almost, of myth-magic, if you get what I mean. That story I\\n\\npassed on about Andy refusing to give Bogs Diamond a head-job is part of that\\nmyth, and how he kept on fighting the sisters is part of it, and how he got the\\nlibrary job is part of it, too . . . but with one important difference: I was\\n\\nthere and I saw what happened, and I swear on my mothers name that its all\\ntrue. The oath of a convicted murderer may not be worth much, but believe this:\\nI dont lie.\\n\\nAndy and I were on fair speaking terms by then. The guy fascinated me. Looking\\nback to the poster episode, I see theres one thing I neglected to tell you, and\\nmaybe I should. Five weeks after he hung Rita up (Id forgotten all about it by\\nthen, and had gone on to other deals), Ernie passed a small white box through\\nthe bars of my cell.\\n\\n\"From Dufresne,\" he said, low, and never missed a stroke with his push-broom.\\n\"Thanks, Ernie,\" I said, and slipped him half a pack of Camels.\\n\\nNow what the hell was this, I was wondering as I slipped the cover from the box.\\nThere was a lot of white cotton inside, and below that . . .\\n\\nI looked for a long time. For a few minutes it was like I didnt even dare touch\\nthem, they were so pretty. Theres a crying shortage of pretty things in the\\nslam, and the real pity of it is that a lot of men dont even seem to miss \\nthem.\\n\\nThere were two pieces of quartz in that box, both of them carefully polished.\\nThey had been chipped into driftwood shapes. There were little sparkles of iron\\n\\n\\npyrites in them like flecks of gold. If they hadnt been so heavy, they would\\nhave served as a fine pair of mens cufflinks-they were that close to being a\\nmatched set.\\n\\nHow much work went into creating those two pieces? Hours and hours after\\nlights-out, I knew that. First the chipping and shaping, and then the almost\\nendless polishing and finishing with those rock-blankets. Looking at them, I\\nfelt the warmth that any man or woman feels when he or she is looking at\\n\\nsomething pretty, something that has been worked and made-thats the thing that\\nreally separates us from the animals, I think-and I felt something else, too. A\\nsense of awe for the mans brute persistence. But I never knew just how\\npersistent Andy Dufresne could be until much later.\\n\\nIn May of 1950, the powers that be decided that the roof of the license-plate\\nfactory ought to be re-surfaced with roofing tar. They wanted it done before it\\ngot too hot up there, and they asked for volunteers for the work, which was\\nplanned to take about a week. More than seventy men spoke up, because it was\\n\\noutside work and May is one damn fine month for outside work. Nine or ten names\\nwere drawn out of a hat, and two of them happened to be Andys and my own.\\n\\nFor the next week wed be marched out to the exercise yard after breakfast, with\\ntwo guards up front and two more behind . . . plus all the guards in the towers\\nkeeping a weather eye on the proceedings through their field-glasses for good\\nmeasure.\\n\\nFour of us would be carrying a big extension ladder on those morning marches - I\\nalways got a kick out of the way Dickie Betts, who was on that job, called that\\nsort of ladder an extensible - and wed put it up against the side of that low,\\n\\nflat building. Then wed start bucket-brigading hot buckets of tar up to the\\nroof. Spill that shit on you and youd jitterbug all the way to the infirmary.\\nThere were six guards on the project, all of them picked on the basis of\\nseniority. It was almost as good as a weeks vacation, because instead of\\nsweating it out in the laundry or the plate-shop or standing over a bunch of\\ncons cutting pulp or brush somewhere out in the fields, they were having a\\nregular May holiday in the sun, just sitting there with their backs up against\\nthe low parapet, shooting the bull back and forth.\\n\\nThey didnt even have to keep more than half an eye on us, because the south\\nwall sentry post was close enough so that the fellows up there could have spit\\ntheir chews on us, if theyd wanted to. If anyone on the roof-sealing party had\\nmade one funny move, it would take four seconds to cut him smack in two with\\n\\n.45-caliber machine-gun bullets. So those screws just sat there and took their\\nease. All they needed was a couple of six-packs buried in crushed ice, and they\\nwould have been the lords of all creation.\\n\\nOne of them was a fellow named Byron Hadley, and in that year of 1950, hed \\nbeen\\n\\n\\nat Shawshank longer than I had. Longer than the last two wardens put together,\\nas a matter of fact. The fellow running the show in 1950 was a prissy-looking\\n\\ndown-east Yankee named George Dunahy. He had a degree in penal administration.\\nNo one liked him, as far as I could tell, except the people who had gotten him \\nhis\\nappointment. I heard that he was only interested in three things: compiling\\n\\nstatistics for a book (which was later published by a small New England outfit\\ncalled Light Side Press, where he probably had to pay to have it done), which\\nteam won the intramural baseball championship each September, and getting a\\ndeath-penalty law passed in Maine. A regular bear for the death penalty was\\nGeorge Dunahy. He was fired from the job in 1953, when it came out he was\\nrunning a discount auto-repair service down in the prison garage and splitting\\n\\nthe profits with Byron Hadley and Greg Stammas. Hadley and Stammas came out of\\nthat one okay-they were old hands at keeping their asses covered-but Dunahy took\\na walk. No one was sorry to see him go, but nobody was exactly pleased to see\\nGreg Stammas step into his shoes, either. He was a short man with a tight, hard\\n\\ngut and the coldest brown eyes you ever saw. He always had a painful, pursed\\nlittle grin on his face, as if he had to go to the bathroom and couldnt quite\\nmanage it. During Stammass tenure as warden there was a lot of brutality at\\n\\nShawshank, and although I have no proof, I believe there were maybe half a dozen\\nmoonlight burials in the stand of scrub forest that lies east of the prison.\\n\\nDunahy was bad, but Greg Stammas was a cruel, wretched, cold-hearted man.\\n\\nHe and Byron Hadley were good friends. As warden, George Dunahy was nothing but\\na posturing figurehead; it was Stammas, and through him, Hadley, who actually\\nadministered the prison.\\n\\nHadley was a tall, shambling man with thinning red hair. He sunburned easily\\nand he talked loud and if you didnt move fast enough to suit him, hed clout \\nyou\\nwith his stick. On that day, our third on the roof, he was talking to another\\nguard named Mert Entwhistle.\\n\\nHadley had gotten some amazingly good news, so he was griping about it. That was\\nhis style-he was a thankless man with not a good word for anyone, a man who was\\nconvinced that the whole world was against him. The world had cheated him out of\\nthe best years of his life, and the world would be more than happy to cheat him\\n\\nout of the rest. I have seen some screws that I thought were almost saintly, and\\nI think I know why that happens -- they are able to see the difference between\\ntheir own lives, poor and struggling as they might be, and the lives of the men\\nthey are paid by the State to watch over. These guards are able to formulate a\\ncomparison concerning pain. Others cant, or wont.\\n\\nFor Byron Hadley there was no basis of comparison. He could sit there, cool and\\nat his ease under the warm May sun, and find the gall to mourn his own good luck\\nwhile less than ten feet away a bunch of men were working and sweating and\\nburning their hands on great big buckets filled with bubbling tar, men who had\\n\\n\\nto work so hard in their ordinary round of days that this looked like a \\nrespite.\\n\\nYou may remember the old question, the one thats supposed to define your\\noutlook on life when you answer it. For Byron Hadley the answer would always be\\nhalf empty, the glass is half empty. Forever and ever, amen. If you gave him a\\n\\ncool drink of apple cider, hed think about vinegar. If you told him his wife\\nhad always been faithful to him, hed tell you it was because she was so damn\\nugly.\\n\\nSo there he sat, talking to Mert Entwhistle loud enough for all of us to hear,\\nhis broad white forehead already starting to redden with the sun. He had one\\n\\nhand thrown back over the low parapet surrounding the roof. The other was on the\\nbutt of his .38.\\n\\nWe all got the story along with Mert. It seemed that Hadleys older brother had\\ngone off to Texas some fourteen years ago and the rest of the family hadnt\\nheard from the son of a bitch since. They had all assumed he was dead, and good\\nriddance. Then, a week and a half ago, a lawyer had called them long-distance\\nfrom Austin. It seemed that Hadleys brother had died four months ago, and a\\nrich man at that (\"Its frigging incredible how lucky some assholes can get,\"\\n\\nthis paragon of gratitude on the plate-shop roof said). The money had come as a\\nresult of oil and oil-leases, and there was close to a million dollars.\\n\\nNo, Hadley wasnt a millionaire-that might have made even him happy, at least\\nfor awhile-but the brother had left a pretty damned decent bequest of\\n\\nthirty-five thousand dollars to each surviving member of his family back in\\nMaine, if they could be found. Not bad. Like getting lucky and winning a\\nsweepstakes.\\n\\nBut to Byron Hadley the glass was always half empty. He spent most of the\\nmorning bitching to Mert about the bite that the goddam government was going to\\ntake out of his windfall. \"Theyll leave me about enough to buy a new car with,\"\\nhe allowed, \"and then what happens? You have to pay the damn taxes on the car,\\nand the repairs and maintenance, you got your goddam kids pestering you to take\\nem for a ride with the top down-\"\\n\\n\"And to drive it, if theyre old enough,\" Mert said. Old Mert Entwhistle knew\\nwhich side his bread was buttered on, and he didnt say what must have been as\\nobvious to him as to the rest of us: If that moneys worrying you so bad, Byron\\nold kid old sock, Ill just take it off your hands. After all, what are friends\\n\\nfor?\\n\\n\"Thats right, wanting to drive it, wanting to learn to drive on it, for\\nChrissake,\" Byron said with a shudder. \"Then what happens at the end of the\\nyear?         If you figured the tax wrong and you dont have enough left over \\nto pay\\nthe overdraft, you got to pay out of your own pocket, or maybe even borrow it\\n\\nfrom one of those kikey loan agencies. And they audit you anyway, you know. It\\n\\n\\ndont matter. And when the government audits you, they always take more. Who can\\nfight Uncle Sam? He puts his hand inside your shirt and squeezes your tit until\\n\\nits purple, and you end up getting the short end. Christ.\"\\n\\nHe lapsed into a morose silence, thinking of what terrible bad luck hed had to\\ninherit that thirty-five thousand dollars. Andy Dufresne had been spreading tar\\nwith a big brush less than fifteen feet away and now he tossed it into his\\n\\npail and walked over to where Mert and Hadley were sitting.\\n\\nWe all tightened up, and I saw one of the other screws, Tim Youngblood, drag his\\nhand down to where his pistol was holstered. One of the fellows in the sentry\\ntower struck his partner on the arm and they both turned, too. For one moment I\\nthought Andy was going to get shot, or clubbed, or both.\\n\\nThen he said, very softly, to Hadley: \"Do you trust your wife?\"\\n\\nHadley just stared at him. He was starting to get red in the face, and I knew\\nthat was a bad sign. In about three seconds he was going to pull his billy club\\nand give Andy the butt end of it right in the solar plexus, where that big \\nbundle\\nof nerves is. A hard enough hit there can kill you, but they always go for it. \\nIf\\nit doesnt kill you it will paralyze you long enough to forget whatever cute\\nmove it was that you had planned.\\n\\n\"Boy,\" Hadley said, \"Ill give you just one chance to pick up that brush. And\\nthen youre goin off this roof on your head.\"\\n\\nAndy just looked at him, very calm and still. His eyes were like ice. It was as\\nif he hadnt heard. And I found myself wanting to tell him how it was, to give\\nhim the crash course. The crash course is you never let on that you hear the\\nguards talking, you never try to horn in on their conversation unless youre\\nasked (and then you always tell them just what they want to hear and shut up\\nagain). Black man, white man, red man, yellow man, in prison it doesnt matter\\n\\nbecause weve got our own brand of equality. In prison every cons a low life, \\nand\\nyou have to get used to the idea if you intend to survive men like Hadley and\\n\\nGreg Stammas, who really would kill you just as soon as look at you. When youre\\nin stir you belong to the State and if you forget it, woe is you. Ive known men\\nwhove lost eyes, men whove lost toes and fingers; I knew one man who lost the\\ntip     of his penis and counted himself lucky that was all he lost. I wanted \\nto\\n\\ntell Andy that it was already too late. He could go back and pick up his brush\\nand there would still be some big lug waiting for him in the showers that night,\\nready to charley-horse both of his legs and leave him writhing on the cement.\\nYou could buy a lug like that for a pack of cigarettes or three Baby Ruths. Most\\nof all, I wanted to tell him not to make it any worse than it already was.\\n\\nWhat I did was to keep on running tar out onto the roof as if nothing at all \\nwas\\n\\n\\nhappening. Like everyone else, I look after my own ass first. I have to. Its\\ncracked already, and in Shawshank there have always been Hadleys willing to\\nfinish the job of breaking it.\\n\\nAndy said, \"Maybe I put it wrong. Whether you trust her or not is immaterial.\\nThe problem is whether or not you believe she would ever go behind your back,\\ntry to hamstring you.\"\\n\\nHadley got Up. Mert got up. Tim Youngblood got up. Hadleys face was as red as\\nthe side of a brick house. \"Your only problem,\" he said, \"is going to be how \\nmany\\nbones you still got unbroken. You can count them in the infirmary. Come on,\\nMert. Were throwing this sucker over the side.\"\\n\\nTim Youngblood drew his gun. The rest of us kept tarring like mad. The sun beat\\ndown. They were going to do it; Hadley and Mert were simply going to pitch him\\nover the side. Terrible accident. Dufresne, prisoner 81433-SHNK, was taking a\\ncouple of empties down and slipped on the ladder. Too bad.\\n\\nThey laid hold of him, Mert on the right arm, Hadley on the left. Andy didnt\\nresist. His eyes never left Hadleys red face.\\n\\n\"If youve got your thumb on her, Mr. Hadley,\" he said in that same calm,\\ncomposed voice, \"theres not a reason why you shouldnt have every cent of that\\nmoney. Final score, Mr. Byron Hadley thirty-five thousand, Uncle Sam zip.\"\\nMert started to drag him toward the edge.\\n\\nHadley just stood there. For a moment Andy was like a rope between them in a \\ntug-of-war\\ngame. Then Hadley said, \"Hold on one second, Mert. What do you mean, boy?\"\\n\\n\"I mean, if youve got your thumb on your wife, you can give it to her,\" Andy\\nsaid.\\n\\n\"You better start making sense, boy, or youre going over.\"\\n\\n\"The IRS allows you a one-time-only gift to your spouse,\" Andy said. \"Its good\\nup to sixty thousand dollars.\"\\n\\nHadley was now looking at Andy as if he had been poleaxed.\\n\"Naw, that aint right,\" he said. \"Tax free?\"\\n\\n\"Tax free,\" Andy said. \"IRS cant touch cent one.\"\\n\"How would you know a thing like that?\"\\n\\n\\nTim Youngblood said: \"He used to be a banker, Byron. I spose he might-\"\\n\"Shut ya head, Trout,\" Hadley said without looking at him.\\n\\nTim Youngblood flushed and shut up.  Some of the guards called him Trout \\nbecause of\\nhis thick lips and buggy eyes.  Hadley kept looking at Andy. \"Youre the smart\\n\\nbanker who shot his wife. Why should I believe a smart banker like you? So I can\\nwind up in here breaking rocks right alongside you? Youd like that, wouldnt\\nyou?\"\\n\\nAndy said quietly: \"If you went to jail for tax evasion, youd go to a federal\\npenitentiary, not Shawshank. But you wont. The tax-free gift to the spouse is a\\nperfectly legal loophole. Ive done dozens . . . no, hundreds of them. Its\\n\\nmeant primarily for people with small businesses to pass on, or for people who\\ncome into one-time-only windfalls. Like yourself.\"\\n\\n\"I think youre lying,\" Hadley said, but he didnt-you could see he didnt.\\n\\nThere was an emotion dawning on his face, something that was grotesque overlying\\nthat long, ugly countenance and that receding, sunburned brow. An almost obscene\\nemotion when seen on the features of Byron Hadley. It was hope.\\n\\n\"No, Im not lying. Theres no reason why you should take my word for it,\\neither. Engage a lawyer-\"\\n\\n\"Ambulance-chasing highway-robbing sob’s!\" Hadley cried.\\n\\nAndy shrugged. \"Then go to the IRS. Theyll tell you the same thing for free.\\nActually, you dont need me to tell you at all. You would have investigated the\\nmatter for yourself.\"\\n\\n\"You’re right. I dont need any smart wife-killing banker to show me where the\\nbears go in the woods.\"\\n\\n\"Youll need a tax lawyer or a banker to set up the gift for you and that will\\ncost you something,\" Andy said. \"Or . . . if you were interested, Id be glad to\\nset it up for you nearly free of charge. The price would be three beers apiece\\nfor my co-workers-\"\\n\\n\"Co-workers,\" Mert said, and let out a rusty guffaw. He slapped his knee. A real\\nknee-slapper was old Mert, and I hope he died of intestinal cancer in a part of\\nthe world where morphine is as of yet undiscovered. \"Co-workers, aint that\\ncute? Co-workers! You aint got any-\"\\n\\n\"Shut your friggin trap,\" Hadley growled, and Mert shut. Hadley looked at Andy\\nagain. \"What was you saying\\n\\n\\n\"I was saying that Id only ask three beers apiece for my coworkers, if that\\nseems fair,\" Andy said. \"I think a man feels more like a man when hes working\\nout of doors in the springtime if he can have a bottle of suds. Thats only my\\nopinion. It would go down smooth, and Im sure youd have their gratitude.\"\\n\\nI have talked to some of the other men who were up there that day - Rennie \\nMartin,\\nLogan St. Pierre, and Paul Bonsaint were three of them - and we all saw the same\\nthing then . . . felt the same thing. Suddenly it was Andy who had the upper\\n\\nhand. It was Hadley who had the gun on his hip and the billy in his hand, Hadley\\nwho had his friend Greg Stammas behind him and the whole prison administration\\nbehind Stammas, the whole power of the State behind that, but all at once in\\n\\nthat golden sunshine it didnt matter, and I felt my heart leap up in my chest\\n\\nas it never had since the truck drove me and four others through the gate back\\nin 1938 and I stepped out into the exercise yard.\\n\\nAndy was looking at Hadley with those cold, clear, calm eyes, and it wasnt just\\nthe thirty-five thousand then, we all agreed on that. Ive played it over and\\n\\nover in my mind and I know. It was man against man, and Andy simply forced\\nhim, the way a strong man can force a weaker mans wrist to the table in a game\\nof Indian rasseling. There was no reason, you see, why Hadley couldntve given\\nMert the nod at that very minute, pitched Andy overside onto his head, and still\\ntaken Andys advice.  No reason. But he didnt.\\n\\n\"I could get you all a couple of beers if I wanted to,\" Hadley said. \"A beer\\n\\ndoes taste good while youre working The colossal bastard even managed to sound\\nmagnanimous.\\n\\n\"Id just give you one piece of advice the IRS wouldnt bother with,\" Andy said.\\nHis eyes were Axed unwinkingly on Hadleys. \"Make the gift to your wife if\\nyoure sure. If you think theres even a chance she might double-cross you or\\nbackshoot you, we could work out something else -- \"\\n\\n\"Double-cross me?\" Hadley asked harshly. \"Double-cross me? Mr. Hotshot Banker,\\nif she ate her way through a boxcar of Ex-Lax, she wouldnt dare fart unless I\\n\\ngave her the nod.\"\\n\\nMert, Youngblood, and the other screws yucked it up dutifully. Andy never\\ncracked a smile.\\n\\n\"Ill write down the forms you need,\" he said. \"You can get them at the post\\noffice, and Ill fill them out for your signature.\"\\n\\nThat sounded suitably important, and Hadleys chest swelled. Then he glared\\naround at the rest of us and hollered, \"What are you jimmies starin at? Move\\n\\n\\nyour asses, goddammit!\" He looked back at Andy. \"You come over here with me,\\nhotshot. And listen to me well: if youre messin’ me somehow, youre gonna find\\nyourself chasing your own head around Shower C before the weeks out.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I understand that,\" Andy said softly.\\n\\nAnd he did understand it. The way it turned out, he understood a lot more than I\\ndid - more than any of us did.\\n\\nThats how, on the second-to-last day of the job, the convict crew that tarred\\nthe plate-factory roof in 1950 ended up sitting in a row at ten oclock on a\\nspring morning, drinking Black Label beer supplied by the hardest screw that\\never walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison. That beer was warm, but it\\nwas still the best I ever had in my life. We sat and drank it and felt the sun\\n\\non our shoulders, and not even the expression of half-amusement, half-contempt\\non Hadleys face-as if he were watching apes drink beer instead of men-could\\nspoil it. It lasted twenty minutes, that beer-break, and for those twenty\\n\\nminutes we felt like free men. We could have been drinking beer and tarring the\\nroof of one of our own houses.\\n\\nOnly Andy didnt drink. I already told you about his drinking habits. He sat\\nhunkered down in the shade, hands dangling between his knees, watching us and\\nsmiling a little. Its amazing how many men remember him that way, and amazing\\n\\nhow many men were on that work-crew when Andy Dufresne faced down Byron Hadley.\\n\\nI thought there were nine or ten of us, but by 1955 there must have been two\\nhundred of us, maybe more . . . if you believed what you heard.\\n\\nSo, yeah-if you asked me to give you a flat-out answer to the question of\\nwhether Im trying to tell you about a man or a legend that got made up around\\nthe man, like a pearl around a little piece of grit-Id have to say that the\\n\\nanswer lies somewhere in between. All I know for sure is that Andy Dufresne\\nwasnt much like me or anyone else I ever knew since I came inside. He brought\\n\\nin five hundred dollars jammed up his back porch, but somehow that graymeat son\\nof a bitch managed to bring in something else as well. A sense of his own worth,\\nmaybe, or a feeling that he would be the winner in the end . . . or maybe it was\\nonly        a sense of freedom, even inside these goddamned gray walls. It was \\na kind\\n\\nof inner light he carried around with him. I only knew him to lose that light\\nonce, and that is also a part of this story.\\n\\nVII\\n\\n\\nBy World Series time of 1950-this was the year the Philadelphia Whiz Kids\\ndropped four straight, you will remember-Andy was having no more trouble from\\nthe sisters. Stammas and Hadley had passed the word. If Andy Dufresne came to\\neither of them, or any of the other screws that formed a part of their coterie,\\n\\nand showed so much as a single drop of blood in his underpants, every sister in\\nShawshank would go to bed that night with a headache. They didnt fight it. As I\\nhave pointed out, there was always an eighteen-year old car thief or a firebug\\n\\nor some guy whod gotten his kicks handling little children. After the day on\\nthe plate-shop roof, Andy went his way and the sisters went theirs.\\n\\nHe was working in the library then, under a tough old con named Brooks Hatlen.\\nHatlen had gotten the job back in the late twenties because he had a college\\neducation. Brooksies degree was in animal husbandry, true enough, but college\\neducations in institutes of lower learning like The Shank are so rare that its\\n\\na case of beggars not being able to be choosers.\\n\\nIn 1952 Brooksie, who had killed his wife and daughter after a losing streak at\\npoker back when Coolidge was President, was paroled. As usual, the State in all\\nits wisdom had let him go long after any chance he might have had to become a\\nuseful part of society was gone. He was sixty-eight and arthritic when he\\ntottered  out of the main gate in his Polish suit and his French shoes, his\\n\\nparole papers in one hand and a Greyhound bus ticket in the other. He was crying\\nwhen he left. Shawshank was his world. What lay beyond its walls was as terrible\\nto Brooks as the Western Seas had been to superstitious fifteenth-century\\n\\nsailors. In prison, Brooksie had been a person of some importance. He was the\\nlibrarian, an educated man. If he went to the Kittery library and asked for a\\njob, they wouldnt even give him a library card. I heard he died in a home for\\nindigent old folks up Freeport way in 1953, and at that he lasted about six\\n\\nmonths longer than I thought he would. Yeah, I guess the State got its own back\\non Brooksie, all right. They trained him to like it inside the shithouse and\\n\\nthen they threw him out.\\n\\nAndy succeeded to Brooksies job, and he was librarian for twenty-three years.\\nHe used the same force of will Id seen him use on Byron Hadley to get what he\\nwanted for the library, and I saw him gradually turn one small room (which still\\nsmelled of turpentine because it had been a paint closet until 1922 and had\\nnever  been properly aired) lined with Readers Digest Condensed Books and\\nNational Geographies into the best prison library in New England.\\n\\nHe did it a step at a time. He put a suggestion box by the door and patiently\\n\\nweeded out such attempts at humor as More Fuk-Boox Pleeze and Excape in 10 EZ\\nLesions. He got hold of the things the prisoners seemed serious about. He wrote\\n\\nto the major book clubs in New York and got two of them, The Literary Guild and\\nThe Book-of-the-Month Club, to send editions of all their major selections to \\nus\\n\\n\\nat a special cheap rate. He discovered a hunger for information on such small\\nhobbies as soap-carving, woodworking, sleight of hand, and card solitaire. He\\ngot     all the books he could on such subjects. And those two jailhouse \\nstaples,\\nErie Stanley Gardner and Louis LAmour. Cons never seem to get enough of the\\ncourtroom or the open range. And yes, he did keep a box of fairly spicy\\npaperbacks   under the checkout desk, loaning them out carefully and making sure\\nthey always got back. Even so, each new acquisition of that type was quickly\\nread to tatters.\\n\\nHe began to write to the State Senate in Augusta in 1954. Stammas was warden by\\nthen, and he used to pretend Andy was some sort of mascot. He was always in the\\nlibrary, shooting the bull with Andy, and sometimes hed even throw a paternal\\n\\narm around Andys shoulders or give him a goose. He didnt fool anybody. Andy\\nDufresne was no ones mascot.\\n\\nHe told Andy that maybe hed been a banker on the outside, but that part of his\\nlife was receding rapidly into his past and he had better get a hold on the\\n\\nfacts of prison life. As far as that bunch of jumped-up Republican Rotarians in\\nAugusta was concerned, there were only three viable expenditures of the\\ntaxpayers money in the field of prisons and corrections. Number one was more\\n\\nwalls, number two was more bars, and number three was more guards. As far as the\\nState Senate was concerned, Stammas explained, the folks in Thomastan and\\nShawshank and Pittsfield and South Portland were the scum of the earth. They\\nwere there to do hard time, and by God and Sonny Jesus, it was hard time they\\nwere going to do. And if there were a few weevils in the bread, wasnt that \\njust\\n\\ntoo fucking bad?\\n\\nAndy smiled his small, composed smile and asked Stammas what would happen to a\\nblock of concrete if a drop of water fell on it once every year for a million\\n\\nyears. Stammas laughed and clapped Andy on the back. \"You got no million years,\\nold horse, but if you did, I bleeve youd do it with that same little grin on\\n\\nyour face. You go on and write your letters. Ill even mail them for you if you\\npay for the stamps.\"\\n\\nWhich Andy did. And he had the last laugh, although Stammas and Hadley werent\\naround to see it. Andys requests for library funds were routinely turned down\\nuntil 1960, when he received a check for two hundred dollars-the Senate probably\\nappropriated it in hopes that he would shut up and go away. Vain hope. Andy felt\\nthat he had finally gotten one foot in the door and he simply redoubled his\\n\\nefforts; two letters a week instead of one. In 1962 he got four hundred dollars,\\nand for the rest of the decade the library received seven hundred dollars a year\\nlike clockwork. By 1971 that had risen to an even thousand. Not much stacked up\\nagainst what your average small-town library receives, I guess, but a thousand\\nbucks can buy a lot of recycled Perry Mason stories and Jake Logan Westerns. By\\nthe time Andy left, you could go into the library (expanded from its original\\n\\n\\npaint-locker to three rooms), and find just about anything youd want. And if\\nyou couldnt find it, chances were good that Andy could get it for you.\\n\\nNow youre asking yourself if all this came about just because Andy told Byron\\nHadley how to save the taxes on his windfall inheritance. The answer is yes.\\n\\nAnd no. You can probably figure out what happened for yourself.\\n\\nWord got around that Shawshank was housing its very own pet financial wizard. In\\nthe late spring and the summer of 1950, Andy set up two trust funds for guards\\nwho wanted to assure a college education for their kids, he advised a couple of\\nothers who wanted to take small fliers in common stock (and they did pretty damn\\nwell, as things turned out; one of them did so well he was able to take an early\\nretirement two years later), and Ill be damned if he didnt advise the warden\\nhimself, old Lemon Lips George Dunahy, on how to go about setting up a\\n\\ntax-shelter for himself. That was just before Dunahy got the bums rush, and I\\nbelieve he must have been dreaming about all the millions his book was going to\\nmake him. By April of 1951, Andy was doing the tax returns for half the screws\\nat Shawshank, and by 1952, he was doing almost all of them. He was paid in what\\nmay be a prisons most valuable coin: simple good will.\\n\\nLater on, after Greg Stammas took over the wardens office, Andy became even\\nmore important-but if I tried to tell you the specifics of just how, Id be\\nguessing. There are some things I know about and others I can only guess at. I\\nknow that there were some prisoners who received all sorts of special\\nconsiderations-radios in their cells, extraordinary visiting privileges, things\\n\\nlike that-and there were people on the outside who were paying for them to have\\nthose privileges. Such people are known as \"angels\" by the prisoners. All at\\n\\nonce some fellow would be excused from working in the plate-shop on Saturday\\nforenoons, and youd know that fellow had an angel out there whod coughed up a\\nchunk  of dough to make sure it happened. The way it usually works is that the\\nangel will pay the bribe to some middle-level screw, and the screw will spread\\n\\nthe grease both up and down the administrative ladder.\\n\\nThen there was the discount auto-repair service that laid Warden Dunahy low. It\\nwent underground for awhile and then emerged stronger than ever in the late\\nfifties. And some of the contractors that worked at the prison from time to time\\nwere paying kickbacks to the top administration officials, Im pretty sure, and\\n\\nthe same was almost certainly true of the companies whose equipment was bought\\nand installed in the laundry and the license-plate shop and the stamping-mill\\n\\nthat was built in 1963.\\n\\nBy the late sixties there was also a booming trade in pills, and the same\\nadministrative crowd was involved in turning a buck on that. All of it added up\\nto              a pretty good-sized river of illicit income. Not like the pile \\nof clandestine\\nbucks that must fly around a really big prison like Attica or San Quentin, but\\n\\n\\nnot peanuts, either. And money itself becomes a problem after awhile. You cant\\njust stuff it into your wallet and then shell out a bunch of crumpled twenties\\n\\nand dog-eared tens when you want a pool built in your back yard or an addition\\nput on your house. Once you get past a certain point, you have to explain where\\nthat money came from . . . and if your explanations arent convincing enough,\\nyoure apt to wind up wearing a number yourself.\\n\\nSo there was a need for Andys services. They took him out of the laundry and\\ninstalled him in the library, but if you wanted to look at it another way, they\\nnever took him out of the laundry at all. They just set him to work washing\\ndirty money instead of dirty sheets He funneled it into stocks, bonds, tax-free\\nmunicipals, you name it.\\n\\nHe told me once about ten years after that day on the plate-shop roof that his\\nfeelings about what he was doing were pretty clear, and that his conscience was\\nrelatively untroubled. The rackets would have gone on with him or without him.\\n\\nHe had not asked to be sent to Shawshank, he went on; he was an innocent man who\\nhad been victimized by colossal bad luck, not a missionary or a do-gooder.\\n\\n\"Besides, Red,\" he told me with that same half-grin, \"what Im doing in here\\nisnt all that different from what I was doing outside. Ill hand you a pretty\\ncynical axiom: the amount of expert financial help an individual or company\\nneeds rises in direct proportion to how many people that person or business is\\nscrewing.\\n\\n\"The people who run this place are stupid, brutal monsters for the most part.\\n\\nThe people who run the straight world are brutal and monstrous, but they happen\\nnot to be quite as stupid, because the standard of competence out there is a\\n\\nlittle higher. Not much, but a little. \"\\n\\n\"But the pills,\" I said. \"I dont want to tell you your business, but they make\\n\\nme nervous. Reds, uppers, downers, Nembutals- now theyve got these things they\\ncall Phase Fours. I wont get anything like that. Never have.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" Andy said. \"I dont like the pills, either. Never have. But Im not much\\nof a one for cigarettes or booze, either. But I dont push the pills. I dont\\nbring them in, and I dont sell them once they are in. Mostly its the screws\\nwho do that.\"\\n\\n\"But-\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, I know. Theres a fine line there. What it comes down to, Red, is some\\npeople refuse to get their hands dirty at all. Thats called sainthood, and the\\npigeons land on your shoulders and crap all over your shirt. The other extreme\\nis to take a bath in the dirt and deal any goddamned thing that will turn a\\n\\n\\ndollar-guns, switchblades big H. what the hell. You ever have a con come up to\\nyou and offer you a contract?\"\\n\\nI nodded. Its happened a lot of times over the years. You are, after all, the\\nman who can get it. And they figure if you can get them batteries for their\\ntransistor radios or cartons of Luckies or lids of reefer, you can put them in\\ntouch with a guy wholl use a knife. \"Sure you have,\" Andy agreed. \"But you\\ndont do it. Because guys like us, Red, we know theres a third choice. An\\nalternative to staying simon-pure or bathing in the filth and the slime. Its\\n\\nthe alternative that grown-ups all over the world pick. You balance off your\\nwalk through the hog-wallow against what it gains you. You choose the lesser of\\ntwo evils and try to keep your good intentions in front of you. And I guess you\\njudge how well youre doing by how well you sleep at night . . . and what your\\ndreams are like. \"\\n\\n\"Good intentions,\" I said, and laughed. \"I know all about that Andy. A fellow\\ncan toddle right off to hell on that road.\"\\n\\n\"Dont you believe it,\" he said, growing somber. \"This is hell right here. Right\\nhere in The Shank. They sell pills and I tell them what to do with the money.\\nBut Ive also got the library, and I know of over two dozen guys who have used\\nthe books in there to help them pass their high school equivalency tests. Maybe\\nwhen they get out of here theyll be able to crawl off the shit heap. When we\\nneeded that second room back in 1957, I got it. Because they want to keep me\\nhappy. I work cheap. Thats the trade-off.\"\\n\\n\"And youve got your own private quarters.\"\\n\"Sure. Thats the way I like it.\"\\n\\nThe prison population had risen slowly all through the fifties, and it damn near\\nexploded in the sixties, what with every college-age kid in America wanting to\\ntry dope and the perfectly ridiculous penalties for the use of a little reefer.\\n\\nBut in all that time Andy never had a cellmate, except for a big, silent Indian\\nnamed Normaden (like all Indians in The Shank, he was called Chief), and\\nNormaden didnt last long. A lot of the other long-timers thought Andy was\\ncrazy, but Andy just smiled. He lived alone and he liked it that way . . . and\\nas hed said, they liked to keep him happy. He worked cheap.\\n\\nPrison time is slow time, sometimes youd swear its stop-time, but it passes. \\nIt passes.\\nGeorge Dunahy departed the scene in a welter of newspaper headlines shouting\\nSCANDAL and NEST-FEATHERING.  Stammas succeeded him, and for the next six\\nyears Shawshank was a kind of living hell. During the reign of Greg Stammas the \\nbeds in\\nthe infirmary and the cells in the Solitary Wing were always full.\\n\\n\\nOne day in 1958 I looked at myself in a small shaving mirror I kept in my cell\\n\\nand saw a forty-year-old man looking back at me. A kid had come in back in 1938,\\na kid with a big mop of carroty red hair, half-crazy with remorse, thinking\\n\\nabout suicide. That kid was gone. The red hair was going gray and starting to\\nrecede. There were crows tracks around the eyes. On that day I could see an old\\nman inside, waiting his time to come out. It scared me. Nobody wants to grow old\\nin stir.\\n\\nStammas went early in 1959. There had been several investigative reporters\\nsniffing around, and one of them even did four months under an assumed name, for\\na crime made up out of whole cloth. They were getting ready to drag out\\n\\nSCANDAL and NEST-FEATHERING again, but before they could bring the hammer\\ndown on him, Stammas ran. I can understand that; boy, can I ever. If he had \\nbeen tried\\nand convicted, he could have ended up right in here. If so, he might have \\nlasted all\\n\\nof five hours. Byron Hadley had gone two years earlier. The sucker had a heart\\nattack and took an early retirement.\\n\\nAndy never got touched by the Stammas affair. In early 1959 a new warden was\\nappointed, and a new assistant warden, and a new chief of guards. For the next\\neight months or so, Andy was just another con again. It was during that period\\nthat Normaden, the big half-breed Passamaquoddy, shared Andys cell with him.\\nThen everything just started up again. Normaden was moved out, and Andy was\\nliving in solitary splendor again. The names at the top change, but the rackets\\nnever do.\\n\\nI talked to Normaden once about Andy. \"Nice Della,\" Normaden said. It was hard\\nto make out anything he said because he had a harelip and a cleft palate; his\\nwords all came out in a slush. \"I liked it there. He never made fun. But he\\n\\ndidnt want me there. I could tell.\" Big shrug. \"I was glad to go, me. Bad draft\\nin that cell. All the time cold. He dont let nobody touch his things. Thats\\nokay. Nice man, never made fun. But big draft.\"\\n\\nVIII\\n\\n\\nRita Hayworth hung in Andys cell until 1955, if I remember right. Then it was\\nMarilyn Monroe, that picture from The Seven-Year Itch where shes standing over\\na subway grating and the warm air is flipping her skirt up. Marilyn lasted until\\n1960, and she was considerably tattered about the edges when Andy replaced her\\nwith Jayne Mansfield. Jayne was, you should pardon the expression, a bust. After\\nonly a year or so she was replaced with an English actress-might have been \\nHazel\\n\\nCourt, but Im not sure. In 1966 that one came down and Raquel Welch went up for\\na record breaking six-year engagement in Andys cell. The last poster to hang\\n\\nthere was a pretty country-rock singer whose name was Linda Ronstadt.\\n\\nI asked him once what the posters meant to him, and he gave me a peculiar,\\nsurprised sort of look. \"Why, they mean the same thing to me as they do to most\\ncons,   I guess,\" he said. \"Freedom. You look at those pretty women and you feel\\nlike you could almost . . . not quite but almost . . . step right through and be\\nbeside them. Be free. I guess thats why I always liked Raquel Welch the best.\\n\\nIt wasnt just her; it was that beach she was standing on. Looked like she was\\ndown in Mexico somewhere. Someplace quiet, where a man would be able to hear\\nhimself think. Didnt you ever feel that way about a picture, Red? That you\\n\\ncould almost step right through it?\"\\n\\nI said Id never really thought of it that way.\\n\\n\"Maybe someday youll see what I mean,\" he said, and he was right. Years later I\\nsaw exactly what he meant . . . and when I did, the first thing I thought of was\\nNormaden, and about how hed said it was always cold in Andys cell.\\n\\nA terrible thing happened to Andy in late March or early April of 1963. I have\\ntold you that he had something that most of the other prisoners, myself\\nincluded, seemed to lack. Call it a sense of equanimity, or a feeling of inner\\npeace, maybe even a constant and unwavering faith that someday the long\\nnightmare would end.\\n\\nWhatever you want to call it, Andy Dufresne always seemed to have his act\\ntogether. There was none of that sullen desperation about him that seems to\\nafflict most lifers after awhile; you could never smell hopelessness on him.\\n\\nUntil that late winter of 63.\\n\\nWe had another warden by then, a man named Samuel Norton. The Mathers, Cotton\\nand Increase, would have felt right at home with Sam Norton. So far as I know,\\n\\nno one had ever seen him so much as crack a smile. He had a thirty-year pin from\\nthe Baptist Advent Church of Eliot. His major innovation as the head of our\\nhappy family was to make sure that each incoming prisoner had a New Testament.\\nHe had a small plaque on his desk, gold letters inlaid in teakwood, which said\\nCHRIST IS MY SAVIOR. A sampler on the wall, made by his wife, read:\\n\\n\\nHIS JUDGMENT COMETH AND THAT RIGHT EARLY.\\n\\nThis latter sentiment cut zero ice with most of us.\\n\\nWe felt that the judgment had already occurred, and we would be willing to\\ntestify with the best of them that the rock would not hide us nor the dead tree\\ngive us shelter. He had a Bible quote for every occasion, did Mr. Sam Norton,\\nand whenever you meet a man like that, my best advice to you would be to grin\\nbig and cover up your balls with both hands.\\n\\nThere were less infirmary cases than in the days of Greg Stammas, and so far as\\nI know the moonlight burials ceased altogether, but this is not to say that\\n\\nNorton was not a believer in punishment. Solitary was always well populated. Men\\nlost their teeth not from beatings but from bread and water diets. It began to\\n\\nbe called grain and drain, as in \"Im on the Sam Norton grain and drain train,\\nboys.\"\\n\\nThe man was the foulest hypocrite that I ever saw in a high position. The\\nrackets I told you about earlier continued to flourish, but Sam Norton added his\\nown new wrinkles. Andy knew about them all, and because we had gotten to be\\n\\npretty good friends by that time, he let me in on some of them. When Andy talked\\nabout them, an expression of amused, disgusted wonder would come over his face,\\nas if he were telling me about some ugly, predatory species of bug that was, by\\n\\nits very ugliness and greed, somehow more comic than terrible.\\n\\nIt was Warden Norton who instituted the \"Inside-Out\" program you may have read\\nabout some sixteen or seventeen years back; it was even written up in Newsweek.\\nIn the press it sounded like a real advance in practical corrections and\\nrehabilitation. There were prisoners out cutting pulpwood, prisoners repairing\\nbridges           and causeways, prisoners constructing potato cellars. Norton \\ncalled it\\n\"Inside-Out\" and was invited to explain it to damn near every Rotary and Kiwanis\\nclub           in New England, especially after he got his picture in Newsweek. \\nThe\\nprisoners called it \"road-ganging,\" but so far as I know, none of them were ever\\ninvited    to express their views to the Kiwanians or the Loyal Order of Moose.\\n\\nNorton was right in there on every operation, thirty-year churchpin and all;\\nfrom cutting pulp to digging storm-drains to laying new culverts under state\\n\\nhighways, there was Norton, skimming off the top. There were a hundred ways to\\ndo it-men, materials, you name it. But he had it coming another way, as well.\\n\\nThe construction businesses in the area were deathly afraid of Nortons\\n\\nInside-Out program, because prison labor is slave labor, and you cant compete\\nwith that. So Sam Norton, he of the Testaments and the thirty-year church-pin,\\nwas passed a good many thick envelopes under the table during his sixteen-year\\ntenure as Shawshanks warden. And when an envelope was passed, he would either\\n\\n\\noverbid the project, not bid at all, or claim that all his Inside-Outers were\\ncommitted elsewhere. It has always been something of a wonder to me that Norton\\nwas never found in the trunk of a Thunderbird parked off a highway somewhere\\ndown in Massachusetts with his hands tied behind his back and half a dozen\\n\\nbullets in his head.\\n\\nAnyway, as the old barrelhouse song says, My God, how the money rolled in.\\nNorton must have subscribed to the old Puritan notion that the best way to\\nfigure out which folks God favors is by checking their bank accounts.\\n\\nAndy Dufresne was his right hand in all of this, his silent partner. The prison\\nlibrary was Andys hostage to fortune. Norton knew it, and Norton used it. Andy\\ntold me that one of Nortons favorite aphorisms was One hand washes the other.\\nSo Andy gave good advice and made useful suggestions. I cant say for sure that\\nhe handtooled Nortons Inside-Out program, but Im damned sure he processed the\\nmoney for the Jesus-shouting son of a whore. He gave good advice, made useful\\nsuggestions, the money got spread around, and . . . son of a bitch! The library\\nwould           get a new set of automotive repair manuals, a fresh set of \\nGrolier\\nEncyclopedias, books on how to prepare for the Scholastic Achievement Tests.\\n\\nAnd, of course, more Erle Stanley Gardners and more Louis LAmours.\\n\\nAnd Im convinced that what happened happened because Norton just didnt want to\\nlose his good right hand. Ill go further: it happened because he was scared of\\n\\nwhat might happen-what Andy might say against him-if Andy ever got clear of\\nShawshank State Prison.\\n\\nI got the story a chunk here and a chunk there over a space of seven years, some\\nof it from Andy-but not all. He never wanted to talk about that part of his\\n\\nlife, and I dont blame him. I got parts of it from maybe half a dozen different\\nsources. Ive said once that prisoners are nothing but slaves, but they have\\n\\nthat slave habit of looking dumb and keeping their ears open. I got it backwards\\nand forwards and in the middle, but Ill give it to you from point A to point Z.\\nand maybe youll understand why the man spent about ten months in a bleak,\\ndepressed daze. See, I dont think he knew the truth until 1963, fifteen years\\nafter        he came into this sweet little hellhole. Until he met Tommy \\nWilliams, I\\ndont think he knew how bad it could get.\\n\\nTommy Williams joined our happy little Shawshank family in November of 1962.\\nTommy thought of himself as a native of Massachusetts, but he wasnt proud; in\\nhis twenty-seven years hed done time all over New England. He was a\\nprofessional thief, and as you may have guessed, my own feeling was that he\\nshould have picked another profession.\\n\\nHe was a married man, and his wife came to visit each and every week. She had an\\nidea that things might go better with Tommy- and consequently better with their\\n\\n\\nthree-year-old son and herself- if he got his high school degree. She talked him\\ninto it, and so Tommy Williams started visiting the library on a regular basis.\\n\\nFor Andy, this was an old routine by then. He saw that Tommy got a series of\\nhigh school equivalency tests. Tommy would brush up on the subjects he had\\npassed in high school-there werent many-and then take the test. Andy also saw\\nthat  he was enrolled in a number of correspondence courses covering the \\nsubjects\\nhe had failed in school or just missed by dropping out.\\n\\nHe probably wasnt the best student Andy ever took over the jumps, and I dont\\nknow if he ever did get his high school diploma, but that forms no part of my\\nstory. The important thing was that he came to like Andy Dufresne very much, as\\nmost people did after awhile.\\n\\nOn a couple of occasions he asked Andy \"what a smart guy like you is doing in\\nthe joint\"-a question which is the rough equivalent of that one that goes\\n\"Whats a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?\" But Andy wasnt the\\ntype to tell him; he would only smile and turn the conversation into some other\\n\\nchannel. Quite normally, Tommy asked someone else, and when he finally got the\\nstory, I guess he also got the shock of his young life.\\n\\nThe person he asked was his partner on the laundrys steam ironer and folder.\\nThe inmates call this device the mangler, because thats exactly what it will do\\nto you if you arent paying attention and get your bad self caught in it. His\\n\\npartner was Charlie Lathrop, who had been in for about twelve years on a murder\\ncharge. He was more than glad to reheat the details of the Dufresne murder trial\\nfor Tommy; it broke the monotony of pulling freshly pressed bedsheets out of the\\nmachine and tucking them into the basket. He was just getting to the jury\\n\\nwaiting until after lunch to bring in their guilty verdict when the trouble\\nwhistle went off and the mangle grated to a stop. They had been feeding in\\nfreshly washed sheets from the Eliot Nursing Home at the far end; these were\\nspat out dry and neatly pressed at Tommys and Charlies end at the rate of one\\nevery five seconds. Their job was to grab them, fold them, and slap them into\\nthe cart, which had already been lined with clean brown paper.\\n\\nBut Tommy Williams was just standing there, staring at Charlie Lathrop, his\\nmouth unhinged all the way to his chest. He was standing in a drift of sheets\\n\\nthat had come through clean and which were now sopping up all the wet muck on\\nthe floor-and in a laundry wetwash, theres plenty of muck.\\n\\nSo the head bull that day, Homer Jessup, comes rushing over, bellowing his head\\noff and on the prod for trouble. Tommy took no notice of him. He spoke to\\nCharlie as if old Homer, who had busted more heads than he could probably count,\\nhadnt been there.\\n\\n\\n\"What did you say that golf pros name was?\"\\n\\n\"Quentin,\" Charlie answered back, all confused and upset by now. He later said\\nthat the kid was as white as a truce flag. \"Glenn Quentin, I think. Something\\nlike that, anyway-\"\\n\\n\"Here now, here now,\" Homer Jessup roared, his neck as red as a roosters comb.\\n\"Get them sheets in cold water! Get quick! Get quick, by Jesus, you-\"\\n\\n\"Glenn Quentin, oh my God,\" Tommy Williams said, and that was all he got to say\\nbecause Homer Jessup, that least peaceable of men, brought his billy down behind\\nhis ear. Tommy hit the floor so hard he broke off three of his front teeth. \\nWhen\\n\\nhe woke up he was in solitary, and confined to same for a week, riding a boxcar\\non Sam Nortons famous grain and drain train. Plus a black mark on his report\\ncard.\\n\\nThat was in early February of 1963, and Tommy Williams went around to six or\\nseven other long-timers after he got out of solitary and got pretty much the\\n\\nsame story. I know; I was one of them. But when I asked him why he wanted it, he\\njust clammed up.\\n\\nThen one day he went to the library and spilled one helluva big budget of\\ninformation to Andy Dufresne. And for the first and last time, at least since he\\nhad approached me about the Rita Hayworth poster like a kid buying his first\\npack of Trojans, Andy lost his cool . . . only this time he blew it entirely.\\n\\nI saw him later that day, and he looked like a man who has stepped on the\\nbusiness end of a rake and given himself a good one, whap between the eyes. His\\nhands were trembling, and when I spoke to him, he didnt answer. Before that\\nafternoon was out he had caught up with Billy Hanlon, who was the head screw,\\nand     set up an appointment with Warden Norton for the following day. He told \\nme\\nlater that he didnt sleep a wink all that night; he just listened to a cold\\n\\nwinter wind howling outside, watched the searchlights go around and around,\\nputting long, moving shadows on the cement walls of the cage he had called home\\nsince Harry Truman was President, and tried to think it all out. He said it was\\n\\nas if Tommy had produced a key which fit a cage in the back of his mind, a cage\\nlike his own cell. Only instead of holding a man, that cage held a tiger, and\\n\\nthat tigers name was Hope. Williams had produced the key that unlocked the cage\\nand the tiger was out, willy-nilly, to roam his brain.\\n\\nFour years before, Tommy Williams had been arrested in Rhode Island, driving a\\nstolen car that was full of stolen merchandise. Tommy turned in his accomplice,\\nthe DA played ball, and he got a lighter sentence . . . two to four, with time\\nserved. Eleven months after beginning his term, his old cellmate got a ticket\\n\\nout and Tommy got a new one, a man named Elwood Blatch. Blatch had been busted\\n\\n\\nfor burglary with a weapon and was serving six to twelve.\\n\\n\"I never seen such a high-strung guy,\" Tommy told me. \"A man like that should\\nnever want to be a burglar, specially not with a gun. The slightest little\\n\\nnoise, hed go three feet into the air . . . and come down shooting, more likely\\nthan not. One night he almost strangled me because some guy down the hall was\\nwhopping on his cell bars with a tin cup.\\n\\n\"I did seven months with him, until they let me walk free. I got time served and\\ntime off, you understand. I cant say we talked because you didnt, you know,\\nexactly hold a conversation with El Blatch. He held a conversation with you. He\\ntalked all the time. Never shut up. If you tried to get a word in, hed shake\\n\\nhis fist at you and roll his eyes. It gave me the cold chills whenever he done\\nthat. Big tall guy he was, mostly bald, with these green eyes set way down deep\\nin the sockets. Jeez, I hope I never see him again.\\n\\n\"It was like a talkin jag every night. Where he grew up, the orphanages he run\\naway from, the jobs he done, the women he fucked, the crap games he cleaned out.\\nI just let him run on. My face aint much, but I didnt want it, you know,\\n\\nrearranged for me.\\n\\n\"According to him, hed burgled over two hundred joints. It was hard for me to\\nbelieve, a guy like him who went off like a firecracker every time someone cut a\\nloud fart, but he swore it was true. Now . . . listen to me, Red. I know guys\\nsometimes make things up after they know a thing, but even before I knew about\\nthis golf pro guy, Quentin, I remember thinking that if El Blatch ever burgled\\n\\nmy house, and I found out about it later, Id have to count myself just about\\nthe luckiest motherfucker going still to be alive. Can you imagine him in some\\nladys bedroom, sifting through her joolry box, and she coughs in her sleep or\\nturns over quick? It gives me the cold chills just to think of something like\\nthat,   I swear on my mothers name it does.\\n\\n\"He said hed killed people, too. People that gave him shit. At least thats\\n\\nwhat he said. And I believed him. He sure looked like a man that could do some\\nkilling. He was just so fucking highstrung! Like a pistol with a sawed-off\\n\\nfiring pin. I knew a guy who had a Smith and Wesson Police Special with a\\nsawed-off firing pin. It wasnt no good for nothing, except maybe for something\\nto      jaw about. The pull on that gun was so light that it would fire if this \\nguy,\\nJohnny Callahan, his name was, if he turned his record-player on full volume and\\nput  it on top of one of the speakers. Thats how El Blatch was. I cant \\nexplain\\n\\nit any better. I just never doubted that he had greased some people.\\n\\n\"So one night, just for something to say, I go: Whod you kill? Like a joke,\\n\\nyou know. So he laughs and says: Theres one guy doing time up-Maine for these\\ntwo people I killed. It was this guy and the wife of the slob whos doing the\\n\\n\\ntime. I was creeping their place and the guy started to give me some shit.\\n\\n\"I cant remember if he ever told me the womans name or not,\" Tommy went on.\\n\"Maybe he did. But in New England, Dufresnes like Smith or Jones in the rest of\\nthe country, because theres so many Frogs up here. Dufresne, Lavesque,\\n\\nOuelette, Poulin, who can remember Frog names? But he told me the guys name. He\\nsaid the guy was Glenn Quentin and he was a prick, a big rich prick, a golf \\npro.\\n\\nEl said he thought the guy might have cash in the house, maybe as much as five\\nthousand dollars. That was a lot of money back then, he says to me. So I go:\\nWhen was that? And he goes: After the war. Just after the war.\\n\\n\"So he went in and he did the joint and they woke up and the guy gave him some\\ntrouble. Thats what El said. Maybe the guy just started to snore, thats what \\nI\\n\\nsay. Anyway, El said Quentin was in the sack with some hotshot lawyers wife and\\nthey sent the lawyer up to Shawshank State Prison. Then he laughs this big\\n\\nlaugh. Holy Christ, I was never so glad of anything as I was when I got my\\nwalking papers from that place.\"\\n\\nIX\\n\\n\\nI guess you can see why Andy went a little wonky when Tommy told him that story,\\nand why he wanted to see the warden right away. Elwood Blatch had been serving a\\nsix-to-twelve rap when Tommy knew him four years before. By the time Andy heard\\nall of this, in 1963, he might be on the verge of getting out . . . or already\\n\\nout. So those were the two prongs of the spit Andy was roasting on-the idea that\\nBlatch might still be in on one hand, and the very real possibility that he\\n\\nmight be gone like the wind on the other.\\n\\nThere were inconsistencies in Tommys story, but arent there always in real\\n\\nlife? Blatch told Tommy the man who got sent up was a hotshot lawyer, and Andy\\nwas a banker, but those are two professions that people who arent very educated\\ncould easily get mixed up. And dont forget that twelve years had gone by\\nbetween the time Blatch was reading the clippings about the trial and the time\\n\\nhe told the tale to Tommy Williams. He also told Tommy he got better than a\\nthousand dollars from a footlocker Quentin had in his closet, but the police\\nsaid at Andys trial that there had been no sign of burglary. I have a few ideas\\nabout that. First, if you take the cash and the man it belonged to is dead, how\\nare you going to know anything was stolen, unless someone else can tell you it\\nwas there to start with? Second, whos to say Blatch wasnt lying about that\\npart of it? Maybe he didnt want to admit killing two people for nothing. \\nThird,\\n\\nmaybe there were signs of burglary and the cops either overlooked them-cops can\\nbe pretty dumb-or deliberately covered them up so they wouldnt screw the DAs\\ncase. The guy was running for public office, remember, and he needed a\\n\\nconviction to run on. An unsolved burglary-murder would have done him no good at\\nall.\\n\\nBut of the three, I like the middle one best. Ive known a few Elwood Blatches\\nin my time at Shawshank-the trigger-pullers with the crazy eyes. Such fellows\\n\\nwant you to think they got away with the equivalent of the Hope Diamond on every\\ncaper, even if they got caught with a two-dollar Timex and nine bucks on the one\\ntheyre doing time for.\\n\\nAnd there was one thing in Tommys story that convinced Andy beyond a shadow of\\na doubt. Blatch hadnt hit Quentin at random. He had called Quentin \"a big rich\\nprick,\" and he had known Quentin was a golf pro. Well, Andy and his wife had\\n\\nbeen going out to that country club for drinks and dinner once or twice a week\\nfor a couple of years, and Andy had done a considerable amount of drinking there\\nonce he found out about his wifes affair. There was a marina with the country\\nclub, and for awhile in 1947 there had been a part-time grease-and-gas jockey\\n\\nworking there who matched Tommys description of Elwood Blatch. A big tall man,\\nmostly bald, with deep-set green eyes. A man who had an unpleasant way of\\nlooking at you, as though he was sizing you up. He wasnt there long, Andy \\nsaid.\\n\\nEither he quit or Briggs, the fellow in charge of the marina, fired him. But he\\nwasnt a man you forgot. He was too striking for that.\\n\\n\\nSo Andy went to see Warden Norton on a rainy, windy day with big gray clouds\\nscudding across the sky above the gray walls, a day when the last of the snow\\nwas starting to melt away and show lifeless patches of last years grass in the\\nfields beyond the prison.\\n\\nThe warden has a good-sized office in the Administration Wing, and behind the\\nwardens desk theres a door which connects with the assistant wardens \\noffice..\\n\\nThe assistant warden was out that day, but a trusty was there. He was a\\n\\nhalf-lame fellow whose real name I have forgotten; all the inmates, me included,\\ncalled him Chester, after Marshal Dillons sidekick. Chester was supposed to be\\nwatering the plants and waxing the floor. My guess is that the plants went\\n\\nthirsty that day and the only waxing that was done happened because of Chesters\\ndirty ear polishing the keyhole plate of that connecting door.\\n\\nHe heard the wardens main door open and close and then Norton saying: \"Good\\nmorning, Dufresne, how can I help you?\"\\n\\n\"Warden,\" Andy began, and old Chester told us that he could hardly recognize\\nAndys voice it was so changed. \"Warden. . . theres something . . . somethings\\nhappened to me thats . . . thats so . . . so . . . I hardly know where to\\n\\nbegin.\"\\n\\n\"Well, why dont you just begin at the beginning?\" the warden said, probably in\\nhis sweetest lets-all-turn-to- the-Twenty-third- Psalm-and-read-in-unison\\nvoice. \"That usually works the best.\"\\n\\nAnd so Andy did. He began by refreshing Norton on the details of the crime he\\n\\nhad been imprisoned for. Then he told the warden exactly what Tommy Williams had\\ntold him. He also gave out Tommys name, which you may think wasnt so wise in\\nlight of later developments, but Id just ask you what else he could have done,\\n\\nif his story was to have any credibility at all.\\n\\nWhen he had finished, Norton was completely silent for some time. I can just see\\nhim, probably tipped back in his office chair under the picture of Governor Reed\\nhanging on the wall, his fingers steepled, his liver lips pursed, his brow\\n\\nwrinkled into ladder rungs halfway to the crown of his head, his thirty-year pin\\ngleaming mellowly.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he said finally. \"Thats the damnedest story I ever heard. But Ill tell\\nyou what surprises me most about it, Dufresne.\"\\n\\n\"Whats that, sir?\"\\n\\n\"That you were taken in by it.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Sir? I dont understand what you mean.\" And Chester said that Andy Dufresne,\\nwho had faced down Byron Hadley on the plate-shop roof thirteen years before, \\nwas\\nalmost floundering for words.\\n\\n\"Well, now,\" Norton said. \"Its pretty obvious to me that this young fellow  \\nWilliams is\\nimpressed with you. Quite taken with you, as a matter of fact. He hears your \\ntale of woe,\\nand its quite natural of him to want to . . . cheer you up, lets say. Quite \\nnatural. Hes a\\nyoung man, not terribly bright. Not surprising he didnt realize what a state \\nit would put\\nyou into. Now what I suggest is-\"\\n\\n\"Dont you think I thought of that?\" Andy asked. \"But Id never told Tommy \\nabout\\n\\nthe man working down at the marina. I never told anyone that-it never even \\ncrossed my\\nmind! But Tommys description of his cellmate and that man . . . theyre \\nidentical!\"\\n\\n\"Well, now, you may be indulging in a little selective perception there,\" \\nNorton\\n\\nsaid with a chuckle. Phrases like that, selective perception, are required \\nlearning for people\\nin the penology and corrections business, and they use them all they can.\\n\\n\"Thats not it at all. Sir.\"\\n\\n\"Thats your slant on it,\" Norton said, \"but mine differs. And lets remember \\nthat I have\\nonly your word that there was such a man working at the Falmouth Hills Country \\nClub\\nback then.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" Andy broke in again. \"No, that isnt true. Because-\"\\n\\n\"Anyway,\" Norton overrode him, expansive and loud, \"lets just look at it from \\nthe other\\nend of the telescope, shall we? Suppose- just suppose, now-that there really \\nwas a fellow\\nnamed Elwood Blotch. \"\\n\\n\"Blatch,\" Andy said tightly.\\n\\n\"Blatch, by all means. And lets say he was Thomas Williams cellmate in Rhode \\nIsland.\\nThe chances are excellent that he has been released by now. Excellent. Why, we \\ndont even\\nknow how much time he might have done there before he ended up with Williams, \\ndo we?\\nOnly that he was doing a six-to-twelve.\"\\n\\n\"No. We dont know how much time hed done. But Tommy said he was a bad actor, a\\ncut-up. I think theres a fair chance that he may still be in. Even if hes \\nbeen released, the\\nprison will have a record of his last known address, the names of his \\nrelatives-\"\\n\\n\"And both would almost certainly be dead ends.\"\\n\\nAndy was silent for a moment, and then he burst out: \"Well, its a chance, \\nisnt it?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, of course it is. So just for a moment, Dufresne, lets assume that Blatch \\nexists and\\nthat he is still safely ensconced in the Rhode Island State Penitentiary. Now \\nwhat is he\\ngoing to say if we bring this kettle of fish to him in a bucket? Is he going to \\nfall down on\\nhis knees, roll his eyes, and say: I did it! I did it! By all means add a life \\nterm onto my\\ncharge!?\"\\n\\n\"How can you be so obtuse?\" Andy said, so low that Chester could barely hear. \\nBut he\\nheard the warden just fine.\\n\\n\"What? What did you call me?\"\\n\"Obtuse.\" Andy cried. \"Is it deliberate?\"\\n\\n\"Dufresne, youve taken five minutes of my time-no, seven- and I have a very \\nbusy\\nschedule today. So I believe well just declare this little meeting closed \\nand-\"\\n\\n\"The country club will have all the old time-cards, dont you realize that?\" \\nAndy shouted.\\n\"Theyll have tax-forms and W-twos and unemployment compensation forms, all \\nwith his\\nname on them! There will be employees there now that were there then, maybe \\nBriggs\\nhimself!  Its been fifteen years, not forever! Theyll remember him! They will \\nremember\\nBlatch. If Ive got Tommy to testify to what Blatch told him, and Briggs to \\ntestify that\\nBlatch was there, actually working at the country club, I can get a new trial! \\nI can-\"\\n\\n\"Guard! Guard. Take this man away!\"\\n\\n\"Whats the matter with you?\" Andy said, and Chester told me he was very nearly\\nscreaming by then. \"Its my life, my chance to get out, dont you see that? And \\n you wont\\nmake    a single long-distance call to at least verify Tommys story? Listen, \\nIll pay for the\\ncall! Ill pay for-\"\\n\\nThen there was a sound of thrashing as the guards grabbed him and started to \\ndrag him\\nout.\\n\\n\"Solitary,\" Warden Norton said dryly. He was probably fingering his thirty-year \\npin as he\\nsaid it. \"Bread and water.\"\\n\\nAnd so they dragged Andy away, totally out of control now, still screaming at \\nthe warden;\\nChester said you could hear him even after the door was shut: \"its my life! \\nIts my life,\\ndont   you understand its my life? \"\\n\\nTwenty days on the grain and drain train for Andy down there in solitary. It \\nwas his\\nsecond jolt in solitary, and his dust-up with Norton was his first real black \\nmark since he\\nhad joined our happy little family.\\n\\nIll tell you a little bit about Shawshanks solitary while were on the \\nsubject. Its something\\nof a throwback to those hardy pioneer days of the early to mid-1700s in Maine. \\nIn those\\n\\n\\ndays no one wasted much time with such things as \"penology\" and rehabilitation\" \\nand\\n\"selective perception.\" In those days, you were taken care of in terms of \\nabsolute black\\nand    white. You were either guilty  or innocent. If you were guilty, you were \\neither hung or\\nput in jail. And if you were sentenced to jail, you did not go to an \\ninstitution. No, you dug\\nyour own jail with a spade provided by the Province of Maine. You dug it as \\nwide and as\\ndeep as you could during the period between sunup and sundown. Then they gave \\nyou a\\ncouple of skins and a bucket, and down you went. Once down, the gazer would bar \\nthe\\ntop     of your hole, throw down some grain or maybe a piece of maggoty meat \\nonce or twice\\na week, and maybe there would be a dipperful of  barley soup on Sunday night. \\nYou\\npissed in the bucket, and you held up the same bucket for water when the gazer \\ncame\\naround  at six in the morning. When it rained, you used the bucket to bail out \\nyour jail-cell\\n\\n. . . unless, that is, you wanted to drown like a rat in a rain barrel.\\n\\nNo one spent a long time \"in the hole,\" as it was called; thirty months was an \\nunusually\\nlong term, and so far as Ive been able to tell, the longest term ever spent \\nfrom which an\\ninmate actually emerged alive was served by the so-called \"Durham Boy,\" a \\nfourteen-year-\\nold psychopath who castrated a schoolmate with a piece of rusty metal. He did \\nseven\\nyears, but of course he went in young and strong.\\n\\nYou have to remember that for a crime that was more serious than petty theft or\\nblasphemy or forgetting to put a snot rag in your pocket when out of doors on \\nthe\\nSabbath,      you were hung. For low crimes such as those just mentioned and \\nfor others like\\nthem, youd do your three or six or nine months in the hole and come out \\nfishbelly white,\\ncringing from the wide-open spaces, your eyes half blind, your teeth more than \\nlikely\\nrocking and rolling in their sockets from the scurvy, your feet crawling with \\nfungus. Jolly\\nold Province of Maine. Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.\\n\\nShawshanks Solitary Wing was nowhere as bad as that . . . I guess. Things come \\nin three\\nmajor degrees in the human experience, I think. Theres good, bad, and \\nterrible. And as\\nyou go down into progressive darkness toward terrible, it gets harder and \\nharder to make\\nsubdivisions.\\n\\nTo get to Solitary Wing you were led down twenty-three steps to a basement \\nlevel where\\nthe only sound was the drip of water. The only light was supplied by a series \\nof dangling\\nsixty-watt bulbs. The cells were keg-shaped, like those wall-safes rich people \\nsometimes\\nhide behind a picture. Like a safe, the round doorways were hinged, and solid \\ninstead of\\nbarred. You got ventilation from above, but no light except for your own \\nsixty-watt bulb,\\nwhich was turned off from a master-switch promptly at 8:00 P.M., an hour before \\nlights-\\nout in the rest of the prison. The light bulb wasnt in a wire mesh cage or \\nanything like\\nthat. The feeling was that if you wanted to exist down there in the dark, you \\nwere\\nwelcome to it. Not many did . . . but after eight, of course, you had no \\nchoice. You had a\\nbunk bolted to the wall and a can with no toilet seat. You had three ways to \\nspend your\\ntime: sitting, shitting, or sleeping. Big choice.\\n\\nTwenty days could get to seem like a year. Thirty days could seem like two, and \\nforty\\n\\n\\ndays like ten. Sometimes you could hear rats in the ventilation system. In a \\nsituation like\\nthat, subdivisions of terrible tend to get lost.\\n\\nIf anything at all can be said in favor of solitary, its just that you get \\ntime to think. Andy\\nhad twenty days in which to think while he enjoyed his grain and drain, and \\nwhen he got\\nout he requested another meeting with the warden. Request denied. Such a \\nmeeting, the\\nwarden told him, would be \"counter-productive.\" Thats another of those phrases \\nyou have\\nto master before you can go to work in the prisons and corrections held.\\n\\nPatiently, Andy renewed his request. And renewed it. And renewed it. He had \\nchanged,\\nhad Andy Dufresne. Suddenly, as that spring of 1963 bloomed around us, there \\nwere lines\\nin his face and sprigs of gray showing in his hair. He had lost that little \\ntrace of a smile that\\nalways seemed to linger around his mouth. His eyes stared out into space more \\noften, and\\nyou get to know that when a man stares that way, he is counting up the years \\nserved, the\\nmonths, the weeks, the days.\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\nHe renewed his request and renewed it. He was patient. He had nothing but time. \\nIt got to\\nbe summer. In Washington, President Kennedy was promising a fresh assault on \\npoverty\\nand on civil rights inequalities, not knowing he had only half a year to live. \\nIn Liverpool, a\\nmusical group called The Beatles was emerging as a force to be reckoned with in \\nBritish\\nmusic, but I guess that no one Stateside had yet heard of them. The Boston Red \\nSox, still\\nfour years away from what New England folks call The Miracle of 67, were \\nlanguishing in\\nthe cellar of the American League. All of those things were going on out in a \\nlarger world\\nwhere people walked free.\\n\\nNorton saw him near the end of June, and this conversation I heard about from \\nAndy\\nhimself some seven years later.\\n\\n\"If its the squeeze, you dont have to worry,\" Andy told Norton in a low \\nvoice. \"Do you\\nthink Id talk that up? Id be cutting my own throat. Id be just as indictable \\nas -- \"\\n\\n\"Thats enough,\" Norton interrupted. His face was as long and cold as a slate \\ngravestone.\\nHe leaned back in his office chair until the back of his head almost touched \\nthe sampler\\nreading    HIS JUDGMENT COMETH AND THAT RIGHT EARLY.\\n\\n\"But-\"\\n\\n\"Dont you ever mention money to me again,\" Norton said. \"Not in this office, \\nnot\\nanywhere. Not unless you want to see that library turned back into a storage \\nroom and\\npaint-locker again. Do you understand?\"\\n\\n\"I was trying to set your mind at ease, thats all.\"\\n\\n\"Well, now, when I need a sorry son of a bitch like you to set my mind at ease, \\nIll retire. I\\nagreed to this appointment because I got tired of being pestered, Dufresne. I \\nwant it to\\nstop. If you want to buy this particular Brooklyn Bridge, thats your affair. \\nDont make it\\nmine. I could hear crazy stories like yours twice a week if I wanted to lay \\nmyself open to\\nthem. Every sinner in this place would be using me for a crying towel. I had \\nmore respect\\nfor you. But this is the end. The end. Have we got an understanding?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" Andy said. \"But Ill be hiring a lawyer, you know.\"\\n\"What in Gods name for?\"\\n\\n\"I think we can put it together,\" Andy said. \"With Tommy Williams and with my\\ntestimony and corroborative testimony from records and employees at the country \\nclub, I\\nthink we can put it together. \"\\n\\n\"Tommy Williams is no longer an inmate of this facility.\"\\n\"What?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Hes been transferred.\"\\n\"Transferred where?\"\\n\"Cashman.   \"\\n\\nAt that, Andy fell silent. He was an intelligent man, but it would have taken an\\nextraordinarily stupid man not to smell deal all over that. Cashman was a \\nminimum-\\nsecurity          prison far up north in Aroostook County. The inmates pick a \\nlot of potatoes, and\\nthats hard work, but they are paid a decent wage for their labor and they can \\nattend\\nclasses  at CVI, a pretty decent vocational-technical institute, if they so \\ndesire. More\\nimportant to a fellow like Tommy, a fellow with a young wife and a child, \\nCashman had a\\nfurlough program . . . which meant a chance to live like a normal man, at least \\non the\\nweekends. A chance to build a model plane with his kid, have sex with his wife, \\nmaybe go\\non         a picnic.\\n\\nNorton had almost surely dangled all of that under Tommys nose with only one\\nstring attached: not one more word about Elwood Blatch, not now, not ever. Or\\nyoull end up doing hard time in Thomaston down there on scenic Route 1 with the\\nreal hard guys, and instead of having sex with your wife youll be having it\\n\\nwith some old bull queer.\\n\\n\"But why?\" Andy said. \"Why would-\"\\n\\n\"As a favor to you,\" Norton said calmly, \"I checked with Rhode Island. They did\\nhave an inmate named Elwood Blatch. He was given what they call a PP-provisional\\nparole, another one of these crazy liberal programs to put criminals out on the\\nstreets. Hes since disappeared. \"\\n\\nAndy said: \"The warden down there . . . is he a friend of yours?\"\\n\\nSam Norton gave Andy a smile as cold as a deacons watch chain. \"We are\\nacquainted,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Why?\" Andy repeated. \"Cant you tell me why you did it? You knew I wasnt going\\nto talk about . . . about anything you might have had going. You knew that. So\\nwhy?\"\\n\\n\"Because people like you make me sick,\" Norton said deliberately. \"I like you\\n\\nright where you are, Mr. Dufresne, and as long as I am warden here at Shawshank,\\nyou are going to be right here. You see, you used to think that you were better\\nthan anyone else. I have gotten pretty good at seeing that on a mans face. I\\nmarked   it on yours the first time I walked into the library. It might as well\\n\\nhave been written on your forehead in capital letters. That look is gone now,\\n\\n\\nand I like that just fine. It is not just that you are a useful vessel, never\\n\\nthink that. It is simply that men like you need to learn humility. Why, you used\\nto walk around that exercise yard as if it was a living room and you were at one\\nof those cocktail parties where the hellbound walk around coveting each others\\nwives and husbands and getting swinishly drunk. But you dont walk around that\\nway anymore. And Ill be watching to see if you should start to walk that way\\nagain. Over a period of years, Ill be watching you ,with great pleasure. Now\\n\\nget the hell out of here.\"\\n\\n\"Okay. But all the extracurricular activities stop now, Norton The investment\\ncounseling, the scams, the free tax advice. It all stops. Get H and R Block to\\ntell       you how to declare your income.\\n\\nWarden Nortons face first went brick-red . . . and then all the color fell out\\nof it. \"Youre going back into solitary for that. Thirty days. Bread and water.\\n\\nAnother black mark. And while youre in think about this: if anything thats\\nbeen going on should stop, the library goes. I will make it my personal \\nbusiness\\n\\nto see that it got back to what it was before you came here. And I will make you\\nlife . . . very hard. Very difficult. Youll do the hardest time it possible to\\n\\ndo. Youll lose that one-bunk Hilton down in Cellblock Five, for starters, and\\nyoull lose those rocks on the windowsill, an youll lose any protection the\\nguards have given you against the sodomites. You will . . . lose everything.\\n\\nClear?\"\\n\\nI guess it was clear enough.\\n\\nXI\\n\\n\\nTime continued to pass-the oldest trick in the world, an maybe the only one that\\nreally is magic. But Andy Dufresne ha changed. He had grown harder. Thats the\\nonly way I can think ( to put it. He went on doing Warden Nortons dirty work\\nand F held onto the library, so outwardly things were about the same. H\\ncontinued to have his birthday drinks and his year-end holiday drinks; he\\ncontinued        to share out the rest of each bottle. I got his fresh rock \\npolishing\\ncloths      from time to time, and in 1967 I g him a new rock-hammer-the one Id\\ngotten him nineteen yea ago had, as I told you, plumb worn out. Nineteen \\nyears.\\n\\nWhen you say it sudden like that, those three syllables sound like the thud and\\ndouble locking of a tomb door. The rock-hammer, which had bee a ten dollar item\\nback then, went for twenty-two by 67. He and had a sad little grin over that.\\n\\nAndy continued to shape and polish the rocks he found in the exercise yard, but\\nthe yard was smaller by then; half of what he been there in 1950 had been\\nasphalted over in 1962. Nonetheless he found enough to keep him occupied, I\\nguess. When he hi finished with each rock he would put it carefully on his winds\\nledge, which faced east. He told me he liked to look at them in the sun, the\\npieces   of the planet he had taken up from the dirt and shaped. Schists,\\n\\nquartzes, granites. Funny little mica-sculptures that were held together with\\nairplane glue. Various sedimentary conglomerates that were polished and cut in\\nsuch       a way that you could see why Andy called them \"millennium \\nsandwiches\"-the\\nlayers of different material that had built up over a period of decades and\\ncenturies.\\n\\nAndy would give his stones and his rock-sculptures away from time to time in\\norder to make room for new ones. He gave me the greatest number, I\\n\\nthink-counting the stones that looked like matched cufflinks, I had five. There\\nwas one of the mica sculptures I told you about, carefully crafted to look like \\na\\nman throwing a javelin, and two of the sedimentary conglomerates, all the levels\\nshowing in smoothly polished cross-section. Ive still got them, and I take \\nthem\\n\\ndown every so often and think about what a man can do, if he has time enough and\\nthe will to use it, a drop at a time.\\n\\nSo, on the outside, at least, things were about the same. If Norton had wanted\\nto break Andy as badly as he had said, he would have had to look below the\\nsurface to see the change. But if he had seen how different Andy had become, I\\nthink Norton would have been well-satisfied with the four years following his\\nclash with Andy.\\n\\nHe had told Andy that Andy walked around the exercise yard as if he were at a\\ncocktail party. That isnt the way I would have put it, but I know what he\\nmeant. It goes back to what I said about Andy wearing his freedom like an\\ninvisible coat, about how he never really developed a prison mentality. His \\neyes\\n\\nnever got that dull look. He never developed the walk that men get when the day\\nis over and they are going back to their cells for another endless night-that\\n\\n\\nflat-footed, hump-shouldered walk. Andy walked with his shoulders squared, and\\nhis step was always light, as if he were heading home to a good home-cooked meal\\nand a good woman instead of to a tasteless mess of soggy vegetables, lumpy\\nmashed potato, and a slice or two of that fatty, gristly stuff most of the cons\\n\\ncalled mystery meat . . . that, and a picture of Raquel Welch on the wall.\\n\\nBut for those four years, although he never became exactly like the Others he\\n\\ndid become silent, introspective, and brooding. Who could blame him? So maybe it\\nwas Warden Norton who was pleased . . . at least, for awhile.\\n\\nHis dark mood broke around the time of the 1967 World Series. That was the dream\\nyear, the year the Red Sox won the pennant instead of placing ninth, as the Las\\n\\nVegas bookies had predicted. When it happened-when they won the American League\\npennant -a kind of ebullience engulfed the whole prison. There was a goofy sort\\n\\nof feeling that if the Dead Sox could come to life, then maybe anybody could do\\nit. I cant explain that feeling now, any more than an ex-Beatlemaniac could\\nexplain that madness, I suppose. But it was real. Every radio in the place was\\n\\ntuned to the games as the Red Sox pounded down the stretch. There was gloom when\\nthe Sox dropped a pair in Cleveland near the end, and a nearly riotous joy when\\n\\nRico Petrocelli put away the pop fly that clinched it. And then there was the\\n\\ngloom that came when Lonborg was beaten in the seventh game of the Series to end\\nthe dream just sort of complete fruition. It probably pleased Norton to no end,\\n\\nthe son of a bitch. He liked his prison wearing sackcloth and ashes.\\n\\nBut for Andy, there was no tumble back down into gloom. He wasnt much of a\\nbaseball fan anyway, and maybe that was why. Nevertheless, he seemed to have\\ncaught the current of good feeling, and for him it didnt peter out again after\\n\\nthe last game of the Series. He had taken that invisible coat out of the closet\\nand put it on again.\\n\\nI remember one bright-gold fall day in very late October, a couple of weeks\\nafter the World Series had ended. It must have been a Sunday, because the\\nexercise yard was full of men \"walking off the week\"-tossing a Frisbee or two,\\npassing around a football, bartering what they had to barter. Others would be at\\nthe long table in the Visitors Hall, under the watchful eyes of the screws,\\ntalking with their relatives, smoking cigarettes, telling sincere lies,\\n\\nreceiving their picked-over care-packages.\\n\\nAndy was squatting Indian fashion against the wall, chunking two small rocks\\ntogether in his hands, his face turned up into the sunlight. It was surprisingly\\nwarm, that sun, for a day so late in the year.\\n\\n\"Hello, Red,\" he called. \"Come on and sit a spell.\"\\nI did.\\n\\n\\n\"You want this?\" he asked, and handed me one of the two carefully polished\\n\"millennium sandwiches\" I just told you about\\n\\n\"I sure do,\" I said. \"Its very pretty. Thank you.\"\\n\\nHe shrugged and changed the subject. \"Big anniversary coming up for you next\\nyear.\"\\n\\nI nodded. Next year would make me a thirty-year man. Sixty per cent of my life\\nspent in Shawshank State Prison.\\n\\n\"Think youll ever get out?\"\\n\\n\"Sure. When I have a long white beard and just about three be marbles left\\nrolling around upstairs.\"\\n\\nHe smiled a little and then turned his face up into the sun again, his eyes\\nclosed. \"Feels good.\"\\n\\n\"I think it always does when you know the damn winters almost right on top of\\nyou.\"\\n\\nHe nodded, and we were silent for awhile.\\n\\n\"When I get out of here,\" Andy said finally, \"Im going where its warm all the\\ntime.\" He spoke with such calm assurance you would have thought he had only a\\nmonth or so left to serve. \"You know where Im goin, Red?\"\\n\\n\"Nope. \"\\n\\n\"Zihuatanejo,\" he said, rolling the word softly from his tongue like music.\\n\"Down in Mexico. Its a little place maybe twenty miles from Playa Azul and\\n\\nMexico Highway Thirty-seven. Its a hundred miles northwest of Acapulco on the\\nPacific Ocean. You know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific?\"\\n\\nI told him I didnt.\\n\\n\"They say it has no memory. And thats where I want to finish out my life, Red.\\nIn a warm place that has no memory.\"\\n\\nHe had picked up a handful of pebbles as he spoke; now he tossed them, one by\\none, and watched them bounce and roll across the baseball diamonds dirt\\ninfield, which would be under a foot of snow before long.\\n\\n\"Zihuatanejo. Im going to have a little hotel down there. Six cabanas along the\\nbeach, and six more set further back, for the highway trade. 111 have a guy\\n\\n\\nwholl take my guests out charter fishing. Therell be a trophy for the guy who\\ncatches the biggest marlin of the season, and Ill put his picture up in the\\nlobby. It wont be a family place. Itll be a place for people on their\\nhoneymoons first or second varieties.\"\\n\\n\"And where are you going to get the money to buy this fabulous place?\" I asked\\n\"Your stock account?\"\\n\\nHe looked at me and smiled. \"Thats not so far wrong,\" he said. \"Sometimes you\\nstartle me, Red.\"\\n\\n\"What are you talking about?\"\\n\\n\"There are really only two types of men in the world when it comes to bad\\ntrouble,\" Andy said, cupping a match between his hands and lighting a \\ncigarette.\\n\\n\"Suppose there was a house full of rare paintings and sculptures and fine old\\nantiques, Red? And suppose the guy who owned the house heard that there was a\\nmonster of a hurricane headed right at it? One of those two kinds of men just\\nhopes    for the best. The hurricane will change course, he says to himself. No\\n\\nright-thinking hurricane would ever dare wipe out all these Rembrandts, my two\\nDegas horses, my Grant Woods, and my Bentons. Furthermore, God wouldnt allow\\nit. And if worse comes to worst, theyre insured. Thats one sort of man. The\\n\\nother sort just assumes that hurricane is going to tear right through the middle\\nof his house. If the weather bureau says the hurricane just changed course, this\\nguy assumes itll change back in order to put his house on ground-zero again.\\nThis second type of guy knows theres no harm in hoping for the best as long as\\nyoure prepared for the worst.\"\\n\\nI lit a cigarette of my own. \"Are you saying you prepared for the eventuality? \\n\"\\n\\n\"Yes. I prepared for the hurricane. I knew how bad it looked. I didnt have much\\ntime, but in the time I had, I operated. I had a friend-just about the only\\n\\nperson who stood by me-who worked for an investment company in Portland. He died\\nabout six years ago. \"\\n\\n\"Sorry. \"\\n\\n“Yeah.” Andy tossed his butt away. \"Linda and I had about fourteen thousand\\ndollars. Not a big bundle, but hell, we were young. We had our whole lives ahead\\nof us.\" He grimaced a little, then laughed. \"When the shit hit the fan, I\\n\\nstarted lugging my Rembrandts out of the path of the hurricane. I sold my stocks\\nand paid the capital gains tax just like a good little boy. Declared \\neverything.\\n\\nDidnt cut any corners.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Didnt they freeze your estate?\"\\n\\n\"I was charged with murder, Red, not dead! You cant freeze the assets of an\\ninnocent man-thank God. And it was awhile before they even got brave enough to\\ncharge me with the crime. Jim-my friend-and I, we had some time. I got hit\\n\\npretty good, just dumping everything like that. Got my nose skinned. But at the\\ntime I had worse things to worry about than a small skinning on the stock\\nmarket.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, Id say you did.\"\\n\\n\"But when I came to Shawshank it was all safe. Its still safe. Outside these\\nwalls, Red, theres a man that no living soul has ever seen face to face. He has\\na Social Security card and a Maine drivers license. Hes got a birth\\ncertificate. Name of Peter Stevens. Nice, anonymous name, huh?\"\\n\\n\"Who is he?\" I asked. I thought I knew what he was going to say, but I couldnt\\nbelieve it.\\n\\n\"Me. \"\\n\\n\"Youre not going to tell me that you had time to set up a false identity while\\nthe bulls were sweating you,\" I said, \"or that you finished the job while you\\nwere on trial for-\"\\n\\n\"No, Im not going to tell you that. My friend Jim was the one who set up the\\nfalse identity. He started after my appeal was turned down, and the major pieces\\nof identification were in his hands by the spring of 1950.\"\\n\\n\"He must have been a pretty close friend,\" I said. I was not sure how much of\\nthis I believed a little, a lot, or none. But the day was warm and the sun was\\nout, and it was one hell of a good story. \"All of thats one hundred per cent\\nillegal, setting up a false ID like that. \"\\n\\n\"He was a close friend,\" Andy said. \"We were in the war together. France,\\nGermany, the occupation. He was a good friend.\\n\\nHe knew it was illegal, but he also knew that setting up a false identity in\\n\\nthis country is very easy and very safe. He took my money my money with all the\\ntaxes on it paid so the IRS wouldnt get too interested-and invested it for\\n\\nPeter Stevens. He did that in 1950 and 1951. Today it amounts to three hundred\\nand seventy thousand dollars, plus change.\"\\n\\nI guess my jaw made a thump when it dropped against my chest, because he \\nsmiled.\\n\\n\\n\"Think of all the things people wish theyd invested in since 1950 or so, and\\ntwo or three of them will be things Peter Stevens was into. If I hadnt ended up\\nin here, Id probably be worth seven or eight million bucks by now. Id have a\\nRolls . . . and probably an ulcer as big as a portable radio.\"\\n\\nHis hands went to the dirt and began sifting out more pebbles. They moved\\ngracefully, restlessly.\\n\\n\"It was hoping for the best and expecting the worst-nothing but that. The false\\nname was. just to keep what little capital I had untainted. It was lugging the\\npaintings out of the path of the hurricane. But I had no idea that the \\nhurricane\\n\\n. . . that it could go on as long as it has.\"\\n\\nI didnt say anything for awhile. I guess I was trying to absorb the idea that\\n\\nthis small, spare man in prison gray next to me could be worth more money than\\nWarden Norton would make in the rest of his miserable life, even with the scams\\nthrown in.\\n\\n\"When you said you could get a lawyer, you sure werent kidding,\" I said at\\n\\nlast. \"For that kind of dough you could have hired Clarence Darrow, or whoevers\\npassing for him these days. Why didnt you, Andy? Christ! You could have been\\nout of here like a rocket.\"\\n\\nHe smiled. It was the same smile that had been on his face when hed told me he\\nand his wife had had their whole lives ahead of them \"No,\" he said.\\n\\n\"A good lawyer would have sprung the Williams kid from Cashman whether he wanted\\nto go or not,\" I said. I was getting carried away now. \"You could have gotten\\n\\nyour new trial, hired private detectives to look for that guy Blatch, and blown\\nNorton out of the water to boot. Why not, Andy?\"\\n\\n\"Because I outsmarted myself. If I ever try to put my hands on Peter Stevenss\\nmoney from inside here, Ill lose every cent of it. My friend Jim could have\\narranged it, but Jims dead. You see the problem? \"\\n\\nI saw it. For all the good that money could do Andy, it might as well have\\nreally belonged to another person. In a way, it did. And if the stuff it was\\n\\ninvested in suddenly turned bad, all Andy could do would be to watch the plunge,\\nto trace it day after day on the stocks and-bonds page of the Press-Herald. \\nIts\\n\\na tough life if you dont weaken, I guess.\\n\\n\"Ill tell you how it is, Red. Theres a big hayfield in the town of Buxton. You\\nknow where Buxton is at, dont you?\"\\n\\nI said I did. It lies right next door to Scarborough.\\n\\n\\n\"Thats right. And at the north end of this particular hayfield theres a rock\\nwall, right out of a Robert Frost poem. And somewhere along the base of that\\nwall is a rock that has no business in a Maine hayfield. Its a piece of\\n\\nvolcanic glass, and until 1947 it was a paperweight on my office desk. My friend\\nJim put it in that wall. Theres a key underneath it. The key opens a safe\\n\\ndeposit box in the Portland branch of the Casco Bank.\"\\n\\n\"I guess youre in a peck of trouble,\" I said. \"When your friend Jim died, the\\nIRS must have opened all of his safe deposit boxes. Along with the executor of\\nhis will, of course.\"\\n\\nAndy smiled and tapped the side of my head. \"Not bad. Theres more up there than\\nmarshmallows, I guess. But we took care of the possibility that Jim might die\\nwhile I was in the slam. The box is in the Peter Stevens name, and once a year\\n\\nthe firm of lawyers that served as Jims executors sends a check to the Casco to\\ncover the rental of the Stevens box.\\n\\n\"Peter Stevens is inside that box, just waiting to get out. His birth\\ncertificate, his Social Security card, and his drivers license. The license is\\nsix      years out of date because Jim died six years ago, true, but its still\\nperfectly renewable for a five-dollar fee. His stock certificates are there, the\\ntax-free municipals, and about eighteen bearer bonds in the amount of ten\\nthousand dollars each.\"\\n\\nI whistled.\\n\\n\"Peter Stevens is locked in a safe deposit box at the Casco Bank in Portland and\\nAndy Dufresne is locked in a safe deposit box at Shawshank,\" he said. \"Tit for\\ntat. And the key that unlocks the box and the money and the new life is under a\\nhunk of black glass in a Buxton hayfield. Told you this much, so Ill tell you\\nsomething else, Red-for the last twenty years, give or take, I have been\\n\\nwatching the papers with a more than usual interest for news of any construction\\nprojects in Buxton. I keep thinking that someday soon Im going to read that\\ntheyre putting a highway through there, or erecting a new community hospital,\\nor building a shopping center. Burying my new life under ten feet of concrete,\\n\\nor spitting it into a swamp somewhere with a big load of fill.\"\\n\\nI blurted, \"Jesus Christ, Andy, if all of this is true, how do you keep from\\ngoing crazy?\"\\n\\nHe smiled. \"So far, all quiet on the Western front.\"\\n\"But it could be years-\"\\n\\n\"It will be. But maybe not as many as the State and Warden Norton think its\\ngoing to be. I just cant afford to wait that long. I keep thinking about\\n\\n\\nZihuatanejo and that small hotel. Thats all I want from my life now, Red, and I\\ndont think thats too much to want. I didnt kill Glenn Quentin and I didnt\\n\\nkill my wife, and that hotel . . . its not too much to want. To swim and get a\\n\\ntan and sleep in a room with open windows and space . . . thats not too much to\\nwant.\"\\n\\nHe slung the stones away.\\n\\n\"You know, Red,\" he said in an offhand voice, \" a place like that . . . Id have\\nto have a man who knows how to get things.\"\\n\\nI thought about it for a long time. And the biggest drawback in my mind wasnt\\neven that we were talking pipedreams in a shitty little prison exercise yard\\n\\nwith armed guards looking down at us from their sentry posts. \"I couldnt do\\nit,\" I said. \"I couldnt get along on the outside. Im what they call an\\ninstitutional man now. In here Im the man who can get it for you, yeah. But \\nout\\n\\nthere, anyone can get it for you. Out there, if you want posters or rock hammers\\nor one particular record or a boat-in-a-bottle model kit, you can use the\\n\\nfucking Yellow Pages. In here, Im the fucking Yellow Pages. I wouldnt know how\\nto begin. Or where.\"\\n\\n\"You underestimate yourself,\" he said. \"Youre a self-educated man, a self-made\\nman. A rather remarkable man, I think.\"\\n\\n\"Hell, I dont even have a high school diploma.\"\\n\\n\"I know that,\" he said. \"But it isnt just a piece of paper that makes a man.\\nAnd it isnt just prison that breaks one, either.\"\\n\\n\"I couldnt hack it outside, Andy. I know that.\"\\n\\nHe got up. \"You think it over,\" he said casually, just as the inside whistle\\nblew. And he strolled off, as if he were a free man who had just made another\\n\\nfree man a proposition. And for awhile just that was enough to make melees free.\\nAndy could do that. He could make me forget for a time that we were both lifers,\\nat the mercy of a hard-ass parole board and a psalm-singing warden who liked\\nAndy Dufresne right where he was. After all, Andy was a lap-dog who could do\\ntax-returns. What a wonderful animal! But by that night in my cell I felt like a\\nprisoner again. The whole idea seemed absurd, and that mental image of blue\\nwater and white beaches seemed more cruel than foolish-it dragged at my brain\\nlike a fishhook. I just couldnt wear that invisible coat the way Andy did. I\\n\\nfell asleep that night and dreamed of a great glassy black stone in the middle\\nof a hayfield; a stone shaped like a giant blacksmiths anvil. I was trying to\\n\\nrock the stone up so I could get the key that was underneath. It wouldnt budge;\\nit was just too damned big. And in the background, but getting closer, I could\\n\\n\\nhear the baying of bloodhounds.\\n\\nXII\\n\\nWhich leads us, I guess, to the subject of jailbreaks. Sure, they happen from\\ntime to time in our happy little family. You dont go over the wall, though, not\\nat Shawshank, not if youre smart. The searchlight beams go all night, probing\\nlong white fingers across the open fields that surround the prison on three\\nsides and the stinking marshland on the fourth. Cons do go over the wall from\\ntime to time, and the searchlights almost always catch them. If not, they get\\n\\npicked up trying to thumb a ride on Highway 6 or Highway 99. If they try to cut\\nacross country, some farmer sees them and just phones the location in to the\\nprison. Cons who go over the wall are stupid cons. Shawshank is no Canon City,\\nbut in a rural area a man humping his ass across country in a gray pajama suit\\nsticks out like a cockroach on a wedding cake.\\n\\nOver the years, the guys who have done the best-maybe oddly, maybe not so\\noddly-are the guys who did it on the spur of the moment. Some of them have gone\\nout    in the middle of a cartful of sheets; a convict sandwich on white, you \\ncould\\nsay. There was a lot of that when I first came in here, but over the years they\\n\\nhave more or less closed that loophole.\\n\\nWarden Nortons famous \"Inside-Out\" program produced its share of escapees, too.\\nThey were the guys who decided they liked what lay to the right of the hyphen\\nbetter than what lay to the left. And again, in most cases it was a very casual\\n\\nkind of thing. Drop your blueberry rake and stroll into the bushes while one of\\nthe screws is having a glass of water at the truck or when a couple o~ them get\\ntoo involved in arguing over yards passing or rushing or the old Boston\\nPatriots.\\n\\nIn 1969, the Inside-Outers were picking potatoes in Sabbatus. It was the third\\nof November and the work was almost done. There was a guard named Henry\\nPugh - and he is no longer a member o our happy little family, believe me –\\nsitting on the back bumper of one of the potato trucks and having his lunch with\\nhis carbine across his knees when a beautiful (or so it was told to me, but\\nsometimes these things get exaggerated) ten-point buck strolled out of the cold\\nearly afternoon mist. Pugh went after it with visions of just how that trophy\\nwould look mounted in his rec room, and while he was doing it, three of his\\ncharges just walked away. Two were recaptured in a Lisbon Falls pinball parlor.\\n\\n\\nThe third has not beer found to this day.\\n\\nI suppose the most famous case of all was that of Sid Nedeau. This goes back to\\n1958, and I guess it will never be topped. Sid was out lining the ball field \\nfor\\n\\na Saturday intramural baseball game when the three oclock inside whistle blew,\\nsignaling the shift change for the guards. The parking lot is just beyond the\\nexercise yard, on the other side of the electrically operated main gate. At\\n\\nthree the gate opens and the guards coming on duty and those going off mingle.\\nTheres a lot of back-slapping and bullyragging, comparison of league bowling\\nscores and the usual number of tired old ethnic jokes.\\n\\nSid just trundled his lining machine right out through the gate, leaving a\\nthree-inch baseline all the way from home plate in the exercise yard to the\\n\\nditch on the far side of Route 6, where they found the machine overturned in a\\npile of lime. Dont ask me how he did it. He was dressed in his prison uniform,\\nhe stood six-feet-two, and he was billowing clouds of lime-dust behind him All I\\ncan figure is that, it being Friday afternoon and all, the guards going off \\nwere\\n\\nso happy to be going off, and the guards coming on were so downhearted to be\\ncoming on, that the members of the former group never got their heads out of the\\nclouds and those in the latter never got their noses off their shoe tops . . .\\n\\nand old Sid Nedeau just sort of slipped out between the two.\\n\\nSo far as I know, Sid is still at large. Over the years, Andy Dufresne and I \\nhad\\n\\na good many laughs over Sid Nedeaus great escape, and when we heard about that\\nairline hijacking for ransom, the one where the guy parachuted from the back\\n\\ndoor of the airplane, Andy swore up and down that D. B. Coopers real name was\\nSid Nedeau.\\n\\n\"And he probably had a pocketful of baseline lime in his pocket for good luck,\"\\nAndy said. \"That lucky son of a bitch.\"\\n\\nBut you should understand that a case like Sid Nedeau, or the fellow who got\\naway clean from the Sabbatus potato-field crew, guys like that are winning the\\nprison version of the Irish Sweepstakes. Purely a case of six different kinds of\\nluck somehow jelling together all at the same moment. A stiff like Andy could\\nwait ninety years and not get a similar break.\\n\\nMaybe you remember, a ways back, I mentioned a guy named Henley Backus, the\\nwashroom foreman in the laundry. He came to Shawshank in 1922 and died in the\\nprison infirmary thirty-one years later. Escapes and escape attempts were a\\n\\nhobby of his, maybe because he never quite dared to take the plunge himself. He\\ncould tell you a hundred different schemes, all of them crackpot, and all of\\n\\nthem had been tried in The Shank at one time or another. My favorite was the\\ntale of Beaver Morrison, a b&e convict who tried to build a glider from scratch\\nin the plate-factory basement. The plans he was working from were in a\\n\\n\\ncirca-1900 book called The Modern Boys Guide to Fan and Adventure. Beaver got\\nit built without being discovered, or so the story goes, only to discover there\\n\\nwas no door from the basement big enough to get the damned thing out. When\\nHenley told that story, you could bust a gut laughing, and he knew a dozen-no,\\ntwo dozen-almost as funny.\\n\\nWhen it came to detailing Shawshank bust-outs, Henley had it down chapter and\\nverse. He told me once that during his time there had been better than four\\nhundred escape attempts that he knew of. Really think about that for a moment\\nbefore you just nod your head and read on Four hundred escape attempts! That\\n\\ncomes out to 12.9 escape attempts for every year Henley Backus was in Shawshank\\nand keeping track of them. The Escape-Attempt-of-the-Month Club. Of course most\\nof them were pretty slipshod affairs, the sort of thing that ends up with a\\n\\nguard grabbing some poor, sidling slobs arm and growling, \"Where do you think\\nyoure going, you happy asshole?\"\\n\\nHenley said hed class maybe sixty of them as more serious attempts, and he\\nincluded the \"prison break\" of 1937, the year before I arrived at The Shank. The\\nnew Administration Wing was under construction then and fourteen cons got out,\\nusing construction equipment in a poorly locked shed. The whole of southern\\nMaine got into a panic over those fourteen \"hardened criminals,\" most of whom\\nwere scared to death and had no more idea of where they should go than a\\njackrabbit does when its headlight-pinned to the highway with a big truck\\n\\nbearing down on it. Not one of those fourteen got away. Two of them were shot\\ndead-by civilians, not police officers or prison personnel-but none got away.\\n\\nHow many had gotten away between 1938, when I came here, and that day in October\\nwhen Andy first mentioned Zihuatanejo to me? Putting my information and Henleys\\ntogether, Id say ten. Ten that got away clean. And although it isnt the kind\\n\\nof thing you can know for sure, Id guess that at least half of those ten are\\ndoing time in other institutions of lower learning like The Shank. Because you\\ndo get institutionalized. When you take away a mans freedom and teach him to\\nlive in a cell, he seems to lose his ability to think in dimensions Hes like\\n\\nthat jackrabbit I mentioned, frozen in the oncoming lights of the truck that is\\nbound to kill it. More often than not a con whos just out will pull some dumb\\njob that hasnt a chance in hell of succeeding . . . and why? Because itll get\\nhim back inside. Back where he understands how things work.\\n\\nAndy wasnt that way, but I was. The idea of seeing the Pacific sounded good,\\nbut I was afraid that actually being there would Scare me to death-the bigness\\nof it.\\n\\nAnyhow, the day of that conversation about Mexico, and about Mr. Peter Stevens \\n.\\n\\n. . that was the day I began to believe that Andy had some idea of doing a\\ndisappearing act. I hoped to God he would be careful if he did, and still, I\\nwouldnt        have bet money on his chances of succeeding. Warden Norton, you \\nsee,\\n\\n\\nwas watching Andy with a special close eye. Andy wasnt just another deadhead\\nwith a number to Norton; they had a working relationship, you might say. Also,\\nAndy had brains and he had heart. Norton was determined to use the one and crush\\nthe other.\\n\\nAs there are honest politicians on the outside-ones who stay bought-there are\\nhonest prison guards, and if you are a good judge of character and if you have\\nsome loot to spread around, I suppose its possible that you could buy enough\\nlook-the-other-way to make a break. Im not the man to tell you such a thing has\\nnever             been done, but Andy Dufresne wasnt the man who could do it. \\nBecause, as\\nIve said, Norton was watching. Andy knew it, and the screws knew it, too.\\n\\nNobody was going to nominate Andy for the Inside-Out program, not as long as\\nWarden Norton was evaluating the nominations. And Andy was not the kind of man\\nto   try a casual Sid Nedeau type of escape.\\n\\nIf I had been him, the thought of that key would have tormented me endlessly. I\\nwould have been lucky to get two hours worth of honest shut-eye a night. Buxton\\nwas less than thirty miles from Shawshank. So near and yet so far.\\n\\nI still thought his best chance was to engage a lawyer and try for the retrial.\\nAnything to get out from under Nortons thumb. Maybe Tommy Williams could be\\nshut  up by nothing more than a cushy furlough program, but I wasnt entirely\\n\\nsure. Maybe a good old Mississippi hard-ass lawyer could crack him . . . and\\nmaybe that lawyer wouldnt even have to work that hard. Williams had honestly\\nliked Andy. Every now and then Id bring these points up to Andy, who would only\\nsmile, his eyes far away, and say he was thinking about it.\\n\\nApparently hed been thinking about a lot of other things, as well.\\n\\nIn 1975, Andy Dufresne escaped from Shawshank. He hasnt been recaptured, and I\\ndont think he ever will be. In fact, I dont think Andy Dufresne even exists\\nanymore. But I think theres a man down in Zihuatanejo, Mexico, named Peter\\nStevens. Probably running a very new small hotel in this year of our Lord 1976.\\n\\nIll tell you what I know and what I think; thats about all I can do, isnt \\nit?\\n\\nOn March 12th, 1975, the cell doors in Cellblock 5 opened at 6:30 A.M., as they\\ndo every morning around here except Sunday. And as they do every day except\\nSunday, the inmates of those cells stepped forward into the corridor and formed\\ntwo lines as the cell doors slammed shut behind them. They walked up to the main\\ncellblock gate, where they were counted off by two guards before being sent on\\ndown    to the cafeteria for a breakfast of oatmeal, scrambled eggs, and fatty\\n\\nbacon.\\n\\n\\nAll of this went according to routine until the count at the cellblock gate.\\nThere should have been twenty-seven. Instead, there were twenty-six. After a\\ncall to the Captain of the Guards, Cellblock 5 was allowed to go to breakfast.\\n\\nThe Captain of the Guards, a not half-bad fellow named Richard Gonyar, and his\\nassistant, a jolly prick named Dave Burkes, came down to Cellblock 5 right away.\\nGonyar re-opened the cell doors and he and Burkes went down the corridor\\ntogether, dragging their sticks over the bars, their guns out. In a case like\\n\\nthat what you usually have is someone who has been taken sick in the night, so\\nsick he cant even step out of his cell in the morning. More rarely, someone has\\ndied . . . or committed suicide.\\n\\nBut this time, they found a mystery instead of a sick man or a dead man. They\\nfound no man at all. There were fourteen cells in Cellblock 5, seven to a side,\\nall fairly neat-restriction of visiting privileges is the penalty for a sloppy\\n\\ncell at Shawshank-and all very empty.\\n\\nGonyars first assumption was that there had been a miscount or a practical\\njoke. So instead of going off to work after breakfast, the inmates of Cellblock\\n5 were sent back to their cells, joking and happy. Any break in the routine was\\nalways welcome.\\n\\nCell doors opened; prisoners stepped in; cell doors closed. Some clown shouting,\\n\"I want my lawyer, I want my lawyer, you guys run this place just like a\\n\\nfrigging prison.\" Burkes: \"Shut up in there, or Ill rank you.\" The clown: \"I\\nranked your wife, Burkie.\" Gonyar: \"Shut up, all of you, or youll spend the day\\nin there.\"\\n\\nHe and Burkes went up the line again, counting noses. They didnt have to go\\nfar.\\n\\n\"Who belongs in this cell?\" Gonyar asked the rightside night guard.\\n\\n\"Andrew Dufresne,\" the rightside answered, and that was all it took. Everything\\nstopped being routine right then. The balloon went up.\\n\\nIn all the prison movies Ive seen, this wailing horn goes off when theres \\nbeen\\n\\na break. That never happens at Shawshank. The first thing Gonyar did was to get\\nin touch with the warden. The second thing was to get a search of the prison\\ngoing. The third was to alert the state police in Scarborough to the \\npossibility\\n\\nof a breakout.\\n\\nThat was the routine. It didnt call for them to search the suspected escapees\\n\\ncell, and so no one did. Not then. Why would they? It was a case of what you see\\nis what you get. It was a small square room, bars on the window and bars on the\\nsliding door. Rocks on the windowsill .\\n\\n\\nAnd the poster, of course. It was Linda Ronstadt by then. The poster was right\\nover his bunk. There had been a poster there, in that exact same place, for\\n\\ntwenty-six years. And when someone, who was Warden Norton himself, as it turned\\nout, poetic justice if there ever was anybody looked behind it, they got one\\n\\nhell of a shock.\\n\\nBut that didnt happen until six-thirty that night, almost twelve hours after\\n\\nAndy had been reported missing, probably twenty hours after he had actually made\\nhis escape.\\n\\nNorton hit the roof.\\n\\nI have it on good authority. Chester, the trusty, who was waxing the hall floor\\nin the Admin Wing that day. He didnt have to polish any keyplates with his ear\\nthat day; he said you could hear the warden clear down to Records & Files as he\\nchewed on Rich Gonyars ass.\\n\\n\"What do you mean, youre satisfied hes not on the prison grounds? What does\\nthat mean? It means you didnt find him! You better find him! You better!\\n\\nBecause I want him! Do you hear me? want him!\" Gonyar said something.\\n\"Didnt happen on your shift? Thats what you say. So far as I can tell, no one\\nknows when it happened. Or how. Or if it really did. Now, I want him in my\\noffice by three oclock this afternoon, or some heads are going to roll. I can\\npromise you that, and I always keep my promises.\"\\n\\nSomething else from Gonyar, something that seemed to provoke Norton to even\\ngreater rage.\\n\\n\"No? Then look at this! Look at this. You recognize it? Last nights tally for\\nCellblock Five. Every prisoner accounted for!  Dufresne was locked up last night\\nat   nine and it is impossible for him to be gone now!  It is impossible!  Now \\nyou\\nAnd him!\"\\n\\nBut at three that afternoon Andy was still among the missing. Norton himself\\nstormed down to Cellblock 5 a few hours later, where the rest of us had been\\nlocked up all of that day. Had we been questioned? We had spent most of that\\nlong day being questioned by harried screws who were feeling the breath of the\\ndragon on the backs of their necks. We all said the same thing: we had seen\\nnothing, heard nothing. And so far as I know, we were all telling the truth. I\\nknow that I was. All we could say was that Andy had indeed been in his cell at\\nthe time of the lock-in, and at lights-out an hour later.\\n\\nOne wit suggested that Andy had poured himself out through the keyhole. The\\n\\nsuggestion earned the guy four days in solitary They were uptight. So Norton \\ncame down.\\n\\n\\nHe stalked down glaring at us with blue eyes nearly hot  enough to strike \\nsparks from the\\ntempered steel bar of our cages. He looked at us as if he believed we were all \\nin on it\\nProbably he did believe it.\\n\\nHe went into Andys cell and looked around. It was just as Andy had left it, the\\nsheets on his bunk turned back but without looking slept-in. Rocks on the\\nwindowsill . . . but not all of them. The ones he liked best he took with him.\\n\\n\"Rocks,\" Norton hissed, and swept them off the window ledge with a clatter.\\nGonyar, who was now on overtime, winced but said nothing .\\n\\nNortons eyes fell on the Linda Ronstadt poster. Linda was looking back over her\\nshoulder, her hands tucked into the back pockets of a very tight pair of\\n\\nfawn-colored slacks. She was wearing a halter and she had a deep California \\ntan.\\n\\nIt must have offended the hell out of Nortons Baptist sensibilities, that\\nposter.\\n\\nWatching him glare at it, I remembered what Andy had once said about feeling he\\ncould almost step through the picture and be with the girl.\\n\\nIn a very real way, that was exactly what he did, as Norton was only seconds\\nfrom discovering.\\n\\n\"Wretched thing!\" he grunted, and ripped the poster from the wall with a single\\nswipe of his hand. And revealed the gaping, crumbled hole in the concrete behind\\nit    .\\n\\nGonyar wouldnt go in.\\n\\nNorton ordered him. God, they must have heard Norton ordering Rich Gonyar to go\\nin there all over the prison, and Gonyar just refused him, point blank.\\n\\n\"Ill have your job for this!\" Norton screamed. He was as hysterical as a woman\\nhaving a hot-flash. He had utterly blown his cool. His neck had turned a rich,\\ndark   red, and two veins stood out, throbbing, on his forehead. \"You can count \\non\\nit, you . . . you Frenchman! Ill have your job and Ill see to it that you\\n\\nnever get another one in any prison system in New England!\"\\n\\nGonyar silently held out his service pistol to Norton, butt first. Hed had \\nenough. He was\\nthen two hours overtime, going on three, and hed just had enough. It was as if \\nAndys\\ndefection from our happy little family had driven Norton right over the edge of \\nsome\\nprivate irrationality that had been there for a long time. . .\\n\\nI dont know what that private irrationality might have been, of course. But I\\ndo know that there were twenty-six cons listening to Norton s little dust-up\\n\\n\\nwith Rich Gonyar that evening as the last of the light faded from a dull\\nlate-winter sky, all of us hard-timers and long-line riders who had seen the\\n\\nadministrators come and go, the hard-asses and the candy-asses alike, and we all\\nknew that Warden Samuel Norton had just passed what the engineers like to call\\n\"the breaking strain.\"\\n\\nAnd by God, it almost seemed to me that somewhere I could hear Andy Dufresne\\nlaughing.\\n\\nNorton finally got a skinny drink of water on the night shift to go into the\\n\\nhole that had been behind Andys poster of Linda Ronstadt. The skinny guards\\nname was Rory Tremont, and he was not exactly a ball of fire in the brains\\ndepartment. Maybe he thought he was going to win a Bronze Star or something. As\\nit    turned out, it was fortunate that Norton got someone of Andys approximate\\nheight and build to go in there; if they had sent a big-assed fellow, as most\\n\\nprison guards seem to be, the guy would have stuck in there as sure as God made\\ngreen grass . . . and he might be there still.\\n\\nTremont went in with a nylon filament rope, which someone had found in the trunk\\nof his car, tied around his waist and a big six-battery flashlight in one hand.\\n\\nBy then Gonyar, who had changed his mind about quitting and who seemed to be the\\nonly one there still able to think clearly, had dug out a set of blueprints.\\n\\nI knew well enough what they showed him, a wall which looked, in cross-section,\\nlike a sandwich. The entire wall was ten feet thick. The inner and outer\\n\\nsections were each about four feet thick. In the center was two feet of\\n\\npipe-space, and you want to believe that was the meat of the thing . . . in more\\nways than one.\\n\\nTremonts voice came out of the hole, sounding hollow and dead. \"Something\\nsmells awful in here, Warden.\"\\n\\n\"Never mind that! Keep going.\"\\n\\nTremonts lower legs disappeared into the hole. A moment later his feet were\\ngone, too. His light flashed dimly back and forth.\\n\\n\"Warden, it smells pretty damn bad.\"\\n\"Never mind, I said!\" Norton cried.\\n\\nDolorously, Tremonts voice floated back: \"Smells like shit. Oh God, thats what\\nit is, its shit, oh my God lemme outta here Im gonna blow my groceries oh \\nshit\\n\\nits shit oh my Gawwwwwd!\" And then came the unmistakable sound of Rory Tremont\\nlosing his last couple of meals.\\n\\n\\nWell, that was it for me. I couldnt help myself. The whole day, hell no, the\\nlast thirty years, all came up on me at once and I started laughing fit to\\n\\nsplit, a laugh such as Id never had since I was a free man, the kind of laugh I\\nnever expected to have inside these gray walls. And oh dear God didnt it feel\\ngood!\\n\\n\"Get that man out of here!\" Warden Norton was screaming, and I was laughing so\\nhard I didnt know if he meant me or Tremont. I just went on laughing and\\nkicking my feet and holding onto my belly. I couldnt have stopped if Norton had\\nthreatened to shoot me dead-bang on the spot. \"Get him OUT!\"\\n\\nWell, friends and neighbors, I was the one who went. Straight down to solitary,\\nand there I stayed for fifteen days. A long shot. But every now and then Id\\nthink about poor old not-too-bright Rory Tremont bellowing oh shit its shit,\\nand then Id think about Andy Dufresne heading south in his own car, dressed in\\na nice suit, and Id just have to laugh. I did that fifteen days in solitary\\npractically standing on my head. Maybe because half of me was with Andy\\n\\nDufresne, Andy Dufresne who had waded in shit and came out clean on the other\\nside, Andy Dufresne, headed for the Pacific.\\n\\nI heard the rest of what went on that night from half a dozen sources. There\\nwasnt all that much, anyway. I guess that Rory Tremont decided he didnt have\\nmuch left to lose after hed lost his lunch and dinner, because he did go on.\\n\\nThere was no danger of falling down the pipe-shaft between the inner and outer\\nsegments of the cellblock wall; it was so narrow that Tremont actually had to\\nwedge himself down. He said later that he could only take half-breaths and that\\nhe knew what it would be like to be buried alive.\\n\\nWhat he found at the bottom of the shaft was a master sewer-pipe which served\\nthe fourteen toilets in Cellblock 5, a porcelain pipe that had been laid\\n\\nthirty-three years before. It had been broken into. Beside the jagged hole in\\nthe pipe, Tremont found Andys rock-hammer.\\n\\nAndy had gotten free, but it hadnt been easy.\\n\\nThe pipe was even narrower than the shaft Tremont had just descended. Rory\\nTremont didnt go in, and so far as I know, no one else did, either. It must\\n\\nhave been damn near unspeakable. A rat jumped out of the pipe as Tremont was\\nexamining the hole and the rock-hammer, and he swore later that it was nearly as\\nbig as a cocker spaniel pup. He went back up the crawlspace to Andys cell like\\n\\na monkey on a stick.\\n\\nAndy had gone into that pipe. Maybe he knew that it emptied into a stream five\\nhundred yards beyond the prison on the marshy western side. I think he did. The\\n\\n\\nprison blueprints were around, and Andy would have found a way to look at them.\\nHe was a methodical cuss. He would have known or found out that the sewer-pipe\\nrunning out of Cellblock 5 was the last one in Shawshank not hooked into the new\\nwaste-treatment plant, and he would have known it was do it by mid- 197 5 or do\\n\\nit never, because in August they were going to switch us over to the new waste \\ntreatment\\nplant, too. Five hundred yards. The length of five football fields. Just shy of \\nhalf a mile. He\\ncrawled that distance, maybe with one of those small pen lights in his hand, \\nmaybe with\\nnothing but a couple of books of matches. He crawled through foulness that I \\neither cant\\nimagine or dont want to imagine. Maybe the rats scattered in front of him, or \\nmaybe they\\nwent for him the way such animals sometimes will when theyve had a chance to \\ngrow\\nbold   in the dark. He must have had just enough clearance at the shoulders to \\nkeep\\n\\nmoving, and he probably had to shove himself through the places where the \\nlengths of\\npipe were joined. If it had been me, the claustrophobia would have driven me \\nmad a dozen\\ntimes over. But he did it.\\n\\nAt the far end of the pipe they found a set of muddy footprints leading out of\\nthe sluggish, polluted creek the pipe fed into. Two miles from there a search\\nparty found his prison uniform. That was a day later.\\n\\nThree months after that memorable day, Warden Norton resigned. He was a broken\\nman, it gives me great pleasure to report. The spring was gone from his step. On\\nhis last day he shuffled act with his head down like an old con shuffling down\\n\\nto the infirmary for his codeine pills. It was Gonyar who took over, and to\\nNorton that must have seemed like the unkindest cut of all. For all I knee, Sam\\nNorton is down there in Eliot now, attending services at the Baptist church\\n\\nevery Sunday, and wondering how the hell Andy Dufresne ever could have gotten\\nthe better of him.\\n\\nI could have told him; the answer to the question is simplicity itself. Some\\nhave got it, Sam. And some dont, and never will.\\n\\n\\nXIII\\n\\nThats what I know; now Im going to tell you what I think I may have it wrong\\non some of the specifics, but Id be willing to let my watch and chain that Ive\\ngot the general outline down pretty well. Because, with Andy being the sort of\\n\\nman that he was, theres only one or two ways that it could have been. And every\\nnow ad then, when I think it out, I think of Normaden, that half-crazy Indian.\\n\"Nice Della,\" Normaden had said after celling with Andy for eight months. \"I was\\nglad to go, me. Bad draft in that cell. All the time cold. He dont let nobody\\ntouch his things. Thats okay. Nice man, never made fun. But big draft.\"\\n\\nPoor crazy Normaden. be knew more than all the rest of us, and he knew it \\nsooner. And\\nit was eight long months before Andy could get him out of there and have the\\n\\ncell to himself again. If it hadnt been for the eight months Normaden had spent\\nwith him after Warden Norton first came in. I do believe that Andy would have\\nbeen free before Nixon resigned.\\n\\nI believe now that it began in 1949, way back then - not with the rock-hammer, \\nbut\\nwith the Rita Hayworth poster.  I told you how nervous he seemed when he asked\\nfor that, nervous and filled with suppressed excitement.  At the time I thought\\n\\nit was just embarrassment, that Andy was the sort of guy whod never want\\nsomeone else to know that he had feet of clay and wanted a woman . . .\\nespecially       if it was a fantasy-woman.  But I think now that I was wrong. \\nI think\\nnow that Andys excitement came from something else altogether.\\n\\nWhat was responsible for the hole that Warden Norton eventually found behind the\\nposter of a girl that hadnt even been born when that photo of Rita Hayworth was\\ntaken?  Andy Dufresnes perseverance and hard work, yeah - I dont take any of \\nthat\\n\\n\\naway from him.  But there were two other elements in the equation: a lot of \\nluck,\\nand WPA concrete.\\n\\nYou dont need me to explain the luck, I guess. The WPA concrete I checked out\\nfor myself. I invested some time and a couple of stamps and wrote first to the\\nUniversity of Maine History Department and then to a fellow whose address they\\nwere able to give me. This fellow had been foreman of the WPA project that built\\nthe Shawshank Max Security Wing.\\n\\nThe wing, which contains Cellblocks 3, 4, and 5, was built in the years 1934-37.\\nNow, most people dont think of cement and concrete as \"technological\\ndevelopments,\" the way we think of cars and oil furnaces and rocket-ships, but\\nthey          really are. There was no modern cement until 1870 or so, and no \\nmodern\\nconcrete until after the turn of the century. Mixing concrete is as delicate a\\nbusiness    as making bread. You can get it too watery or not watery enough. You\\ncan get the sand-mix too thick or too thin, and the same is true of the\\n\\ngravel-mix. And back in 1934, the science of mixing the stuff was a lot less\\nsophisticated than it is today.\\n\\nThe walls of Cellblock 5 were solid enough, but they werent exactly dry and\\ntoasty. As a matter or fact, they were and are pretty damned dank. After a long\\nwet spell they would sweat and sometimes even drip. Cracks had a way of\\nappearing, some an inch deep. They were routinely mortared over.\\n\\nNow here comes Andy Dufresne into Cellblock 5. Hes a man who graduated from the\\nUniversity of Maines school of business, but hes also a man who took two or\\n\\nthree geology courses along the E way. Geology had, in fact, become his chief\\nhobby. I imagine it appealed to his patient, meticulous nature. A\\n\\nten-thousand-year ice age here. A million years of mountain-building there.\\nPlates of bedrock grinding against each other deep under the earths skin over\\nthe millennia. Pressure. Andy told me once that all of geology is the study of\\npressure.\\n\\nAnd time, of course. He had time to study those walls.  Plenty of time. When \\nthe cell door\\nslams and the lights go out, theres nothing else to look at.\\n\\nFirst-timers usually have a hard time adjusting to the confinement of prison\\nlife. They get screw-fever. Sometimes they have to be hauled down to the\\ninfirmary and sedated a couple of times before they get on the beam. Its not\\n\\nunusual to hear some new member of our happy little family banging on the bars\\nof his cell and screaming to be let out . . . and before the cries have gone on\\n\\nfor long, the chant starts up along the cellblock: \"Fresh fish, hey little\\nfishie, fresh fish, fresh fish, got fresh fish today!\"\\n\\nAndy didnt flip out like that when he came to The Shank in 1948, but thats \\nnot\\n\\n\\nto say that he didnt feel many of the same things. He may have come close to\\nmadness; some do, and some go sailing right over the edge. Old life blown away\\nin     the wink of an eye, indeterminate nightmare stretching out ahead, a long\\nseason in hell.\\n\\nSo what did he do, I ask you? He searched almost desperately for something to\\ndivert his restless mind. Oh, there are all sorts of ways to divert yourself,\\n\\neven in prison; it seems like the human mind is full of an infinite number of\\npossibilities when it comes to diversion. I told you about the sculptor and his\\nThree Ages of Jesus. There were coin collectors who were always losing their\\ncollections to thieves, stamp collectors, one fellow who had postcards from\\nthirty-five different countries-and let me tell you, he would have turned out\\nyour lights if hed caught you diddling with his postcards.\\n\\nAndy got interested in rocks. And the walls of his cell.\\n\\nI think that his initial intention might have been to do no more than to carve\\nhis initials into the wall where the poster of Rita Hayworth would soon be\\nhanging. His initials, or maybe a few lines from some poem. Instead, what he\\nfound was that interestingly weak concrete. Maybe he started to carve his\\ninitials and a big chunk of the wall just fell out. I can see him, lying there\\n\\non his bunk, looking at that broken chunk of concrete, turning it over in his\\nhands. Never mind the wreck of your whole life, never mind that you got\\nrailroaded into this place by a whole trainload of bad luck. Lets forget all\\nthat and look at this piece of concrete.\\n\\nSome months further along he might have decided it would be fun to see how much\\nof that wall he could take out. But you cant just start digging into your wall\\n\\nand then, when the weekly inspection (or one of the surprise inspections that\\nare always turning up interesting caches of booze, drugs, dirty pictures, and\\nweapons) comes around, say to the guard: \"This? Just excavating a little hole in\\nmy   cell wall. Not to worry, my good man.\"\\n\\nNo, he couldnt have that. So he came to me and asked if I could get him a Rita\\nHayworth poster. Not a little one but a big one.\\n\\nAnd, of course, he had the rock-hammer. I remember thinking when I got him that\\ngadget back in 48 that it would take a man six hundred years to burrow through\\nthe wall with it. True enough. But Andy only had to go through half the wall-and\\neven with the soft concrete, it took him two rock-hammers and twenty-seven years\\nto do it.\\n\\nOf course he lost most of one of those years to Normaden, and he could only work\\nat night, preferably late at night, when almost everybody is asleep-including\\n\\nthe guards who work the night shift. But I suspect the thing which slowed him\\n\\n\\ndown the most was getting rid of the wall as he took it out. He could muffle the\\nsound of his work by wrapping the head of his hammer in rock-polishing cloths,\\nbut what to do with the pulverized concrete and the occasional chunks that came\\nout whole?\\n\\nI think he must have broken up the chunks into pebbles and . . .\\n\\nI remembered the Sunday after I had gotten him the rockhammer. I remember\\nwatching him walk across the exercise yard, his face puffy from his latest\\n\\ngo-round with the sisters. I saw him stoop, pick up a pebble . . . and it\\ndisappeared up his sleeve. That inside sleeve-pocket is an old prison trick. Up\\nyour sleeve or just inside the cuff of your pants. And I have another memory,\\n\\nvery strong but unfocused, maybe something I saw more than once. This memory is\\nof Andy Dufresne walking across the exercise yard on a hot summer day when the\\nair was utterly still. Still, yeah . . . except for the little breeze that\\n\\nseemed to be blowing sand around Andy Dufresnes feet. So maybe he had a couple\\nof cheaters in his pants below the knees. You loaded the cheaters up with fill\\n\\nand then just strolled around, your hands in your pockets, and when you felt\\nsafe and unobserved, you gave the pockets a little twitch. The pockets, of\\ncourse, are attached by string or strong thread to the cheaters. The fill goes\\n\\ncascading out of your pants legs as you walk. The World war II POWs who were\\ntrying to tunnel out used the dodge.\\n\\nThe years went past and Andy brought his wall out to the exercise yard cupful by\\ncupful. He played the game with administrator after administrator, and they\\nthought it was because he wanted to keep the library growing. I have no doubt\\nthat was part of it, but the main thing Andy wanted was to keep Cell 14 in\\nCellblock 5 a single occupancy.\\n\\nI doubt if he had any real plans or hopes of breaking out, at least not at\\n\\nfirst. He probably assumed the wall was ten feet of solid concrete, and that if\\nhe succeeded in boring all the way through it, hed come out thirty feet over\\nthe exercise yard. But like I say, I dont think he was worried overmuch about\\n\\nbreaking through. His assumption could have run this way: I m only making a foot\\nof progress every seven years or so; therefore, it would take me seventy years\\n\\nto break through; that would make me one hundred and one years old.\\n\\nHeres a second assumption I would have made, had I been Andy: that eventually I\\nwould be caught and get a lot of solitary time, not to mention a very large\\n\\nblack mark on my record. After all, there was the regular weekly inspection and\\na surprise toss-which usually came at night-every second week or so. He must\\nhave decided that things couldnt go on for long. sooner or later, some screw\\nwas going to peek behind Rita Hayworth just to make sure Andy didnt have a\\nsharpened spoon-handle or some marijuana reefers Scotch-taped to the wall.\\n\\n\\nAnd his response to that second assumption must have been To hell with it. Maybe\\nhe even made a game out of it. How far in can I get before they find out? \\nPrison\\n\\nis a goddam boring place, and the chance of being surprised by an unscheduled\\ninspection in the middle of the night while he had his poster unstuck probably\\nadded some spice to his life during the early years.\\n\\nAnd I do believe it would have been impossible for him to get away with it just\\non dumb luck. Not for twenty-seven years. Nevertheless, I have to believe that\\nfor the first two years- until mid-May of 1950, when he helped Byron Hadley get\\naround the tax on his windfall inheritance-thats exactly what he did get by \\non.\\n\\nOr maybe he had something more than dumb luck going for him even back then. He\\nhad money, and he might have been slipping someone a little squeeze every week\\n\\nto take it easy on him. Most guards will go along with that if the price is\\nright; its money in their pockets and the prisoner gets to keep his whack off\\npictures or his tailor made cigarettes. Also, Andy was a model prisoner- quiet,\\nwell-spoken, respectful, non-violent. Its the crazies and the stampeders that\\nget         their cells turned upside-down at least once every six months, their\\nmattresses unzipped, their pillows taken away and cut open, the outflow pipe\\nfrom their toilets carefully probed.\\n\\nThen, in 1950, Andy became something more than a model prisoner. In 1950, he\\nbecame a valuable commodity, a murderer who did tax-returns better than H&R\\nBlock. He gave gratis estate-planning advice, set up tax-shelters, filled out\\n\\nloan applications (sometimes creatively). I can remember him sitting behind his\\ndesk in the library, patiently going over a car-loan agreement paragraph by\\n\\nparagraph with a screwhead who wanted to buy a used DeSoto, telling the guy what\\nwas good about the agreement and what was bad about it, explaining to him that\\n\\nit was possible to shop for a loan and not get hit quite so bad, steering him\\naway from the finance companies, which in those days were sometimes little it\\nbetter than legal loan sharks. When he d finished, the screwhead started to put\\nout his hand . . . and then drew it back to himself quickly. He d forgotten for\\na moment, you see, that he was dealing with a mascot, not a man.\\n\\nAndy kept up on the tax laws and the changes in the stock markets and so his\\nusefulness didnt end after he d been in cold storage for awhile, as it might\\nhave done. He began to get his library money, his running war with the sisters\\nhad ended, and nobody tossed his cell very hard. He was a good nigger.\\n\\nThen one day, very late in the going-perhaps around October of 1967-the\\n\\nlong-time hobby suddenly turned into something else. One night while was in the\\nhole up to his waist with Raquel Welch hanging down over his ass, the pick end \\nof\\nhis rock-hammer must have suddenly sunk into concrete past the hilt.\\n\\nHe would have dragged some chunks of concrete back, but maybe he heard other\\nfalling down into that shaft, bouncing back and forth, clinking of that\\n\\n\\nstandpipe. Did he know by then that he was going to come upon that shaft, or was\\nhe totally surprised? I dont know. He might have seen the prison blueprints by\\nthen or he might not have. If not, you can be damned sure he found a way to look\\nat them not long after.\\n\\nAll at once he must have realized that, instead of just playing a game, he was\\nplaying for high stakes . . . in terms of his own life and his own future, tie\\nhighest. Even then he couldnt have known for sure, but he muss have had a\\npretty good idea because it was right around then that he talked to me about\\nZihuatanejo for the first time. All of a sudden, instead of just being a toy,\\n\\nthat stupid hole in the wall became his master-if he knew about the sewer-pipe\\nat the bottom and that it led under the outer wall, it did, anyway.\\n\\nHed had the key under the rock in Buxton to worry about for years. Now he had D\\nworry that some eager-beaver new guard would look behind his poster and expose\\nthe whole thing, or that he would get another cellmate, or that he would, after\\n\\nall those years, suddenly be transferred He had all those things on his mind for\\nthe next eight years. All Scan say is that he must have been one of the coolest\\nmen who ever lived. I would have gone completely nuts after awhile, living with\\nal that uncertainty. But Andy just went on playing the game.\\n\\nHe had to carry tie possibility of discovery for another eight years-the\\nprobability )f it, you might say, because no matter how carefully he stacked tie\\ncards    in his favor, as an inmate of a state prison, he just didnt have that\\n\\nmany to stack . . . and the gods had been kind to him for a very long time; some\\nnineteen years.\\n\\nThe most ghastly irony I can think of would have been if he had been offered a\\nparole. Can you imagine it? Three days before the parolee is actually released,\\nhe is transferred into the light security wing to undergo a complete physical\\nand a battery of vocational tests. While hes there, his old cell is completely\\ncleaned out. Instead of getting his parole, Andy would have gotten a long turn\\ndownstairs in solitary, followed by some more time upstairs . . . but in a\\ndifferent cell.\\n\\nIf he broke into the shaft in 1967, how come he didnt escape until 1975 ? I\\ndont know for sure-but I can advance some pretty good guesses.\\n\\nFirst, he would have become more careful than ever. He was too smart to just\\npush ahead at flank speed and try to get out in eight months, or even in\\neighteen. He must have gone on widening the opening on the crawlspace a little\\nat       a time. A hole as big as a teacup by the time he took his New Years \\nEve\\ndrink that year. A hole as big as a dinner-plate by the time he took his\\n\\nbirthday drink in 1968. As big as a serving-tray by the time the 1969 baseball\\nseason opened.\\n\\n\\nFor a time I thought it should have gone much faster than it apparently\\n\\ndid-after he broke through, I mean. It seemed to me that, instead of hating to\\npulverize the crap and take it out of his cell in the cheater gadgets I have\\ndescribed, he could simply let it drop down the shaft. The length of time he\\ntook makes me believe that he didnt dare do that. He might have decided that\\nthe noise would arouse someones suspicions. Or, if he knew about the\\n\\nsewer-pipe, as I believe he must have, he would have been afraid that a falling\\nchunk of concrete would break it before he was ready, screwing up the cellblock\\nsewage system and leading to an investigation. And an investigation, needless to\\nsay, would lead to ruin.\\n\\nStill and all, Id guess that, by the time Nixon was sworn in for his second\\n\\nterm, the hole would have been wide enough for him to wriggle through . . . and\\nprobably sooner than that. Andy was a small guy.\\n\\nWhy didnt he go then?\\n\\nThats where my educated guesses run out, folks; from this point they become\\nprogressively wilder. One possibility is that the crawlspace itself was clogged\\nwith crap and he had to clear it out. But that wouldnt account for all the\\ntime. So what was it?\\n\\nI think that maybe Andy got scared.\\n\\nIve told you as well as I can how it is to be an institutional man. At first\\n\\nyou cant stand those four walls, then you get so you can abide them, then you\\nget so you accept them . . . and then, as your body and your mind and your\\nspirit adjust to life on an HO scale, you get to love them. You are told when to\\neat, when you can write letters, when you can smoke. If youre at work in the\\nlaundry or the plate-shop, youre assigned five minutes of each hour when you\\ncan  go to the bathroom. For thirty-five years, my time was twenty-five minutes\\nafter the hour, and after thirty-five years, thats the only time I ever felt\\n\\nthe need to take a piss or have a crap: twenty-five minutes past the hour. And\\nif for some reason I couldnt go, the need would pass at thirty after, and come\\nback at twenty-five past the next hour.\\n\\nI think Andy may have been wrestling with that tiger-that institutional\\nsyndrome-and also with the bulking fears that all of it might have been for\\nnothing.\\n\\nHow many nights must he have lain awake under his poster, thinking about that\\nsewer line, knowing that the one chance was all hed ever get? The blueprints\\nmight have told him how big the pipes bore was, but a blueprint couldnt tell\\nhim what it would be like inside that pipe-if he would be able to breathe\\n\\nwithout choking, if the rats were big enough and mean enough to fight instead \\nof\\n\\n\\nretreating . . . and a blueprint couldntve told him what hed find at the end\\nof the pipe, when and if he got there. Heres a joke even funnier than the\\n\\nparole would have been: Andy breaks into the sewer line, crawls through five\\nhundred yards of choking, shit-smelling darkness, and comes up against a\\nheavy-gauge mesh screen at the end of it all. Ha, ha, very funny.\\n\\nThat would have been on his mind. And if the long shot actually came in and he\\nwas able to get out, would he be able to get some civilian clothes and get away\\nfrom the vicinity of the prison undetected? Last of all, suppose he got out of\\nthe pipe, got away from Shawshank before the alarm was raised, got to Buxton,\\noverturned the right rock. . . and found nothing beneath? Not necessarily\\nsomething      so dramatic as arriving at the right field and discovering that a\\nhighrise apartment building had been erected on the spot, or that it had been\\nturned into a supermarket parking lot.\\n\\nIt could have been that some little kid who liked rocks noticed that piece of\\nvolcanic glass, turned it over, saw the deposit-box key, and took both it and\\n\\nthe rock back to his room as souvenirs. Maybe a November hunter kicked the rock,\\nleft the key exposed, and a squirrel or a crow with a liking for bright shiny\\n\\nthings had taken it away. Maybe there had been spring floods one year, breaching\\nthe wall, washing the key away. Maybe anything.\\n\\nSo I think-wild guess or not-that Andy just froze in place for awhile. After\\nall, you cant lose if you dont bet. What did he have to lose, you ask? His\\nlibrary, for one thing. The poison peace of institutional life, for another. Any\\nfuture chance to grab his safe identity.\\n\\nBut he finally did it, just as I have told you. He tried . . . and, my! Didnt\\nhe succeed in spectacular fashion? You tell me!\\n\\nBut did he get away, you ask? What happened after? What happened when he got to\\nthat meadow and turned over that rock . . . always assuming the rock was still\\nthere? I cant describe that scene for you, because this institutional man is\\n\\nstill in this institution, and expects to be for years to come. But Ill tell\\n\\nyou this. Very late in the summer of 1975, on September 15th, to be exact, I \\ngot\\n\\na postcard which had been mailed from the tiny town of McNary, Texas. That town\\nis on the American side of the border, directly across from El Porvenir. The\\nmessage side of the card was totally blank. But I know. I know it in my heart as\\nsurely     as I know that were all going to die someday.\\n\\nMcNary was where he crossed. McNary, Texas.\\n\\nSo thats my story, Jack. I never believed how long it would take to write it\\nall down, or how many pages it would take. I started writing just after I got\\n\\nthat postcard, and here I am finishing up on January 14th, 1976. Ive used three\\npencils right down to knuckle-stubs, and a whole tablet of paper. Ive kept the\\n\\n\\npages carefully hidden. . . not that many could read my hen-tracks, anyway.\\nIt stirred up more memories than I ever would have believed. Writing about\\nyourself seems to be a lot like sticking a branch into clear river-water and\\nroiling up the muddy bottom.\\n\\nWell, you werent writing about yourself I hear someone in the peanut-gallery\\nsaying. You were writing about Andy Dufresne. Youre nothing but a minor\\ncharacter in your own story. But you know, thats just not so. Its all about\\n\\nme, every damned word of it. Andy was the part of me they could never lock up,\\nthe part of me that will rejoice when the gates finally open for me and I walk\\n\\nout in my cheap suit with my twenty dollars of mad-money in my pocket. That part\\nof me will rejoice no matter how old and broken and scared the rest of me is. I\\nguess its just that Andy had more of that part than me, and used it better.\\n\\nThere are others here like me, others who remember Andy. Were glad hes gone,\\nbut a little sad, too. Some birds are not meant to be caged, thats all. Their\\nfeathers are too bright, their songs too sweet and wild. So you let them go, or\\n\\nwhen you open the cage to feed them they somehow fly out past you. And the part\\nof you that knows it was wrong to imprison them in the first place rejoices, but\\nstill, the place where you live is that much more drab and empty for their\\ndeparture.\\n\\nThats the story and Im glad I told it, even if it is a bit inconclusive and\\n\\neven though some of the memories the pencil prodded up (like that branch poking\\nup the river-mud) made me feel a little sad and even older than I am. Thank you\\nfor listening. And Andy, if youre really down there, as I believe you are, \\nlook\\n\\nat the stars for me just after sunset, and touch the sand, and wade in the\\nwater, and feel free.\\n\\n\\nXIV\\n\\nI never expected to take up this narrative again, but here I am with the\\n\\ndog-eared, folded pages open on the desk in front of me. Here I am adding\\nanother three or four pages, writing in a brand-new tablet. A tablet I bought in\\na store-I just walked into a store on Portlands Congress Street and bought it.\\nI thought I had put finish to my story in a Shawshank prison cell on a bleak\\nJanuary day in 1976. Now its May of 1977 and I am sitting in a small, cheap\\nroom of the Brewster Hotel in Portland, adding to it.\\n\\nThe window is open, and the sound of the traffic floating in seem huge,\\nexciting, and intimidating. I have to look constantly over at the window and\\nreassure myself that there are no bars on it. I sleep poorly at night because\\n\\nthe bed in this room, as cheap as the room is, seems much too big and luxurious.\\nI snap awake every morning promptly at six-thirty, feeling disoriented and\\nfrightened. M) dreams are bad. I have a crazy feeling of free fall. The\\n\\nsensation is as terrifying as it is exhilarating.\\n\\nWhat has happened in my life? Cant you guess? I was paroled. After \\nthirty-eight\\n\\n\\nyears of routine hearings and routine denials (in the course of those\\n\\nthirty-eight years, three lawyers died on me), my parole was granted. I suppose\\nthey decided that, at the age of fifty-eight, I was finally used up enough to be\\ndeemed safe.\\n\\nI came very close to burning the document you have just read. They search\\noutgoing parolees almost as carefully as they search incoming \"new fish.\" And\\nbeyond containing enough dynamite to assure me of a quick turnaround and another\\nsix  or eight years inside, my \"memoirs\" contained something else: the name of\\n\\nthe town where I believe Andy Dufresne to be. Mexican police gladly cooperate\\nwith the American police, and I didnt want my freedom-or my unwillingness to\\ngive up the story Id worked so long and hard to write-to cost Andy his.\\n\\nThen I remembered how Andy had brought in his five hundred dollars back in 1948,\\nand I took out my story of him the same way. Just to be on the safe side, I\\n\\ncarefully rewrote each page which mentioned Zihuatanejo. If the papers had been\\nfound during my \"outside search,\" as they call it at The Shank, I would have\\ngone back in on turnaround . . . but the cops would have been looking for Andy\\nin   a Peruvian seacoast town named Las Intrudres.\\n\\nThe Parole Committee got me a job as a \"stock-room assistant\" at 310 the big\\nFoodWay Market at the Spruce Mall in South Portland - which means I became just\\none more aging bag-boy. Theres only two kinds of bag-boys, you know; the old\\nones and the young ones. No one ever looks at either kind. If you shop at the\\nSpruce Mall FoodWay, I may have even taken your groceries out to your car . . .\\nbut youd have had to have shopped there between March and April of 1977,\\nbecause thats as long as I worked there.\\n\\nAt first I didnt think I was going to be able to make it on the outside at \\nall.\\n\\nIve described prison society as a scaled-down model of your outside world, but\\n\\nI had no idea of how fast things moved on the outside; the raw speed people move\\nat. They even talk faster. And louder.\\n\\nIt was the toughest adjustment Ive ever had to make, and I havent finished\\nmaking it yet . . . not by a long way. Women, for instance. After hardly knowing\\nthat they were half of the human race for forty years, I was suddenly working in\\na store filled with them. Old women, pregnant women wearing tee-shirts with\\n\\narrows pointing downward and a printed motto reading BABY HERE, skinny women\\nwith their nipples poking out at their shirts-a woman wearing something like\\n\\nthat when I went in would have gotten arrested and then had a sanity\\nhearing-women of every shape and size. I found myself going around with a\\nsemi-hard almost all the time and cursing myself for being a dirty old man.\\n\\nGoing to the bathroom, that was another thing. When I had to go (and the urge\\nalways came on me at twenty-five past the hour), I had to fight the almost\\noverwhelming need to check it with my boss. Knowing that was something I could\\n\\n\\njust go and do in this too bright outside world was one thing; adjusting my\\ninner self to that knowledge after all those years of checking it with the\\nnearest screwhead or facing two days in solitary for the oversight . . . that\\nwas something else.\\n\\nMy boss didnt like me. He was a young guy, twenty-six or -seven, and I could\\nsee that I sort of disgusted him, the way a cringing, servile old dog that\\n\\ncrawls up to you on its belly to be petted will disgust a man. Christ, I\\ndisgusted myself. But . . . I couldnt make myself stop. I wanted to tell him:\\n\\nThats what a whole life in prison does for you, young man. It turns everyone in\\na position of authority into a master, and you into every masters dog. Maybe\\nyou know youve become a dog, even in prison, but since everyone else in gray is\\na dog, too, it doesnt seem to matter so much. Outside, it does. But I couldnt\\n\\ntell a young guy like him. He would never understand. Neither would my PO, a\\nbig, bluff ex-Navy man with a huge red beard and a large stock of Polish jokes.\\nHe saw me for about five minutes every week. \"Are you staying out of the bars,\\nRed?\" hed ask when hed run out of Polish jokes. Id say yeah, and that would\\nbe the end of it until next week.\\n\\nMusic on the radio. When I went in, the big bands were just getting up a good\\nhead of steam. Now every song sounds like its about fucking. So many cars. At\\nfirst I felt like I was taking my life into my hands every time I crossed the\\nstreet.\\n\\nThere was more-everything was strange and frightening-but maybe you get the\\nidea, or can at least grasp a corner of it. I began to think about doing\\n\\nsomething to get back in. When youre on parole, almost anything will serve. Im\\nashamed to say it, but I began to think about stealing some money or shoplifting\\nstuff from the FoodWay, anything, to get back in where it was quiet and you knew\\neverything that was going to come up in the course of the day.\\n\\nIf I had never known Andy, I probably would have done that. But I kept thinking\\nof him, spending all those years chipping patiently away at the cement with his\\nrock-hammer so he could be free. I thought of that and it made me ashamed and\\nId         drop the idea again. Oh, you can say he had more reason to be free \\nthan I\\n\\ndid- he had a new identity and a lot of money. But thats not really true, you\\nknow. Because he didnt know for sure that the new identity was still there, and\\nwithout the new identity, the money would always be out of reach. No, what he\\nneeded was just to be free, and if I kicked away what I had, it would be like\\nspitting in the face of everything he had worked so hard to win back.\\n\\nSo what I started to do on my time off was to hitchhike rides down to the little\\ntown of Buxton. This was in the early April of 1977, the snow just starting to\\nmelt off the fields, the air just beginning to be warm, the baseball teams\\n\\ncoming north to start a new season playing the only game Im sure God approves\\n\\n\\nof. When I went on these trips, I carried a Silva compass in my pocket.\\nTheres a big hay field in Buxton, Andy had said, and at the north end of that\\nhayfield theres a rock wall, right oat of a Robert Frost poem. And somewhere\\nalong the base of that wall is a rock that has no earthly business in a Maine\\nhayfield.\\n\\nA fools errand, you say. How many hayfields are there in a small rural town\\nlike Buxton? Fifty? A hundred? Speaking from personal experience, Id put it at\\neven higher than that, if you add in the fields now cultivated which might have\\nbeen haygrass when Andy went in. And if I did find the right one, I might never\\nknow it. Because I might overlook that black piece of volcanic glass, or, much\\nmore likely, Andy put it into his pocket and took it with him.\\n\\nSo Id agree with you. A fools errand, no doubt about it. Worse, a dangerous\\none for a man on parole, because some of those fields were clearly marked with\\n\\nNO TRESPASSING signs. And, as Ive said, theyre more than happy to slam your\\nass back inside if you get out of line. A fools errand . . . but so is \\nchipping\\n\\nat a blank concrete wall for twenty-seven years. And when youre no longer the\\nman who can get it for you and just an old bag-boy, its nice to have a hobby to\\ntake your mind off your new life. My hobby was looking for Andys rock.\\n\\nSo Id hitchhike to Buxton and walk the roads. Id listen to the birds, to the\\nspring runoff in the culverts, examine the bottles the retreating snows had\\nrevealed-all useless non-returnables, I am sorry to say; the world seems to have\\ngotten awfully spendthrift since I went into the slam-and looking for \\nhayfields.\\n\\nMost of them could be eliminated right off. No rock walls. Others had rock\\nwalls, but my compass told me they were facing the wrong direction. I walked\\nthese wrong ones anyway. It was a comfortable thing to be doing, and on those\\noutings I really felt free, at peace. An old dog walked with me one Saturday.\\n\\nAnd one day I saw a winter-skinny deer.\\n\\nThen came April 23rd, a day Ill not forget even if I live another fifty-eight\\nyears. It was a balmy Saturday afternoon, and I was walking up what a little \\nboy\\n\\nfishing from a bridge told me was called The Old Smith Road. I had taken a lunch\\nin a brown FoodWay bag, and had eaten it sitting on a rock by the road. When\\n\\nI was done I carefully buried my leavings, as my dad taught me before he died,\\nwhen I was a sprat no older than the fisherman who had named the road for me.\\nAround two oclock I came to a big field on my left. There was a stone wall at\\nthe    far end of it, running roughly northwest. I walked back to it, squelching\\nover the wet ground, and began to walk the wall. A squirrel scoffed me from an\\noak tree.\\n\\nThree-quarters of the way to the end, I saw the rock. No mistake. Black glass\\nand as smooth as silk. A rock with no earthly business in a Maine hayfield. For\\na long time I just looked at it, feeling that I might cry, for whatever reason.\\n\\n\\nThe squirrel had followed me, and it was still chattering away. My heart was\\nbeating madly.\\n\\nWhen I felt I had myself under control, I went to the rock, squatted beside\\nit-the joints in my knees went off like a double-barreled shotgun-and let my\\n\\nhand touch it. It was real. I didnt pick it up because I thought there would be\\nanything under it; I could just as easily have walked away without finding what\\nwas beneath. I certainly Clad no plans to take it away with me, because I didnt\\nfeel it was mine to take-I had a feeling that taking that rock from the field\\nwould have been the worst kind of theft. No, I only picked it up to feel it\\nbetter, to get the heft of the thing, and, I suppose, to prove its reality by\\nfeeling its satiny texture against my skin.\\n\\nI had to look at what was underneath for a long time. My eyes saw it, but it\\ntook awhile for my mind to catch up. It was an envelope, carefully wrapped in a\\nplastic bag to keep away the damp. My name was written across the front in\\nAndys clear script.\\n\\nI took the envelope and left the rock where Andy had left it, and Andys friend\\nbefore him.\\n\\nDear Red,\\n\\nIf youre reading this, then youre out. One way or another, youre out. And f\\nyouve followed along this far, you might be willing to come a little further.\\n\\nI think you remember the name of the town, dont you? I could use a good man\\nto help me get my project on wheels. Meantime, have a drink on me-and do think\\nit over. I will be keeping an eye out for you. Remember that hope is a good\\nthing, Red, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. I will be\\nhoping that this letter finds you, and finds you well.\\n\\nYour friend,\\nPeter Stevens\\n\\nI didnt read that letter in the field. A kind of terror had come over me, a\\nneed to get away from there before I was seen. To make what may be an\\nappropriate pun, I was in terror of being apprehended.\\n\\nI went back to my room and read it there, with the smell of old mens dinners\\ndrifting up the stairwell to me-Beefaroni, RiceaRoni, NoodleRoni. You can bet\\nthat whatever the old folks of America, the ones on fixed incomes, are eating\\ntonight, it almost certainly ends in “roni.”\\n\\nI opened the envelope and read the letter and then I put my head in my arms and\\ncried. With the letter there were twenty new fifty dollar bills.\\n\\n\\nAnd here I am in the Brewster Hotel, technically a fugitive from justice\\n\\nagain-parole violation is my crime. No ones going to throw up any roadblocks to\\ncatch a criminal wanted on that charge, I guess-wondering what I should do now.\\nI have this manuscript. I have a small piece of luggage about the size of a\\ndoctors bag that holds everything I own. I have nineteen fifties, four tens, a\\n\\nfive, three ones, and assorted change. I broke one of the fifties to buy this\\ntablet of paper and a deck of smokes.\\n\\nWondering what I should do.\\n\\nBut theres really no question. It always comes down to just two choices. Get\\nbusy living or get busy dying.\\n\\nFirst Im going to put this manuscript back in my bag. Then Im going to buckle\\nit up, grab my coat, go downstairs, and check out of this fleabag. Then Im\\ngoing to walk uptown to a bar and put that five-dollar bill down in front of the\\nbartender and ask him to bring me two straight shots of Jack Daniels-one for me\\nand  one for Andy Dufresne. Other than a beer or two, theyll be the first \\ndrinks\\nIve taken as a free man since 1938. Then I am going to tip the bartender a\\n\\ndollar and thank him kindly. I will leave the bar and walk up Spring Street to\\n\\nthe Greyhound terminal there and buy a bus ticket to El Paso by way of New York\\nCity. When I get to El Paso, Im going to buy a ticket to McNary. And when I get\\nto McNary, I guess Ill have a chance to find out if an old crook like me can\\n\\nfind a way to float across the border and into Mexico.\\n\\nSure I remember the name. Zihuatanejo. A name like that is just too pretty to\\nforget.\\n\\nI find I am excited, so excited I can hardly hold the pencil in my trembling\\nhand. I think it is the excitement that only a free man can feel, a free man\\nstarting a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain.\\n\\nI hope Andy is down there.\\n\\nI hope I can make it across the border.\\n\\nI hope to see my friend and shake his hand.\\n\\nI hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams.\\nI hope.\\n\\nThe End\\n\\n\\nThe Green Mile\\nPart One:\\nThe Two Dead Girls\\n1.\\nThis happened in 1932, when the state penitentiary was still at Cold Mountain. And the electric chair was\\nthere, too, of course.\\nThe inmates made jokes about the chair, the way people always make jokes about things that frighten\\n\\n\\x0cthem but cant be gotten away from. They called it Old Sparky, or the Big Juicy. They made cracks about\\nthe power bill, and how Warden Moores would cook his Thanksgiving dinner that fall, with his wife,\\nMelinda, too sick to cook.\\nBut for the ones who actually had to sit down in that chair, the humor went out of the situation in a hurry.\\nI presided over seventy-eight executions during my time at Cold Mountain (thats one figure Ive never\\nbeen confused about; Ill remember it on my deathbed), and I think that, for most of those men, the truth\\nof what was happening to them finally hit all the way home when their ankles were being clamped to the\\nstout oak of \"Old Sparkys\" legs. The realization came then (you would see it rising in their eyes, a kind\\nof cold dismay) that their own legs had finished their careers. The blood still ran in them, the muscles\\nwere still strong, but they were finished, all the same; they were never going to walk another country\\nmile or dance with a girl at a barn-raising. Old Sparkys clients came to a knowledge of their deaths from\\nthe ankles up. There was a black silk bag that went over their heads after they had finished their rambling\\nand mostly disjointed last remarks. It was supposed to be for them, but I always thought: it was really for\\nus, to keep us from seeing the awful tide of dismay in their eyes as they realized they were going to die\\nwith their knees bent.\\nThere was no death row at Cold Mountain, only E Block, set apart from the other four and about a\\nquarter their size, brick instead of wood, with a horrible bare metal roof that glared in the summer sun\\nlike a delirious eyeball. Six cells inside, three on each side of a wide center aisle, each almost twice as\\nbig as the cells in the other four blocks. Singles, too. Great accommodations for a prison (especially in\\nthe thirties), but the inmates would have traded for cells in any of the other four. Believe me, they would\\nhave traded.\\nThere was never a time during my years as block superintendent when all six cells were occupied at one\\ntime-thank God for small favors. Four was the most, mixed black and white (at Cold Mountain, there was\\nno segregation among the walking dead), and that was a little piece of hell. One was a woman, Beverly\\nMcCall. She was black as the ace of spades and as beautiful as the sin you never had nerve enough to\\ncommit. She put up with six years of her husband beating her, but wouldnt put up with his creeping\\naround for a single day. On the evening after she found out he was cheating, she stood waiting for the\\nunfortunate Lester McCall, known to his pals (and, presumably, to his extremely short-term mistress) as\\nCutter, at the top of the stairs leading to the apartment over his barber shop. She waited until he got his\\novercoat half off, then dropped his cheating guts onto his two-tone shoes. Used one of Cutters own\\nrazors to do it. Two nights before she was due to sit in Old Sparky, she called me to her cell and said she\\nhad been visited by her African spirit-father in a dream. He told her to discard her slave-name and to die\\nunder her free name, Matuomi. That was her request, that her death warrant should be read under the\\nname of Beverly Matuomi. I guess her spirit-father didnt give her any first name, or one she could make\\nout, anyhow. I said yes, okay, fine. One thing those years serving as the bull-goose screw taught me was\\nnever to refuse the condemned unless I absolutely had to. In the case of Beverly Matuomi, it made no\\ndifference anyway. The governor called the next day around three in the afternoon, commuting her\\nsentence to life in the Grassy Valley Penal Facility for Women-all penal and no penis, we used to say\\nback then. I was glad to see Bevs round ass going left instead of right when she got to the duty desk, let\\nme tell you.\\nThirty-five years or so later - had to be at least thirty-five - I saw that name on the obituary page of the\\npaper, under a picture of a skinny-faced black lady with a cloud of white hair and glasses with\\nrhinestones at the corners. It was Beverly. Shed spent the last ten years of her life a free woman, the\\n\\n\\x0cobituary said, and had rescued the small-town library of Raines Falls pretty much single-handed. She had\\nalso taught Sunday school and had been much loved in that little backwater. LIBRARIAN DIES OF\\nHEART FAILURE, the headline said, and below that, in smaller type, almost as an afterthought: Served\\nOver Two Decades in Prison for Murder. Only the eyes, wide and blazing behind the glasses with the\\nrhinestones at the corners, were the same. They were the eyes of a woman who even at seventy-whatever\\nwould not hesitate to pluck a safety razor from its blue jar of disinfectant, if the urge seemed pressing.\\nYou know murderers, even if they finish up as old lady librarians in dozey little towns. At least you do if\\nyouve spent as much time minding murderers as I did. There was only one time I ever had a question\\nabout the nature of my job. That, I reckon, is why Im writing this.\\nThe wide corridor up the center of E Block was floored with linoleum the color of tired old limes, and so\\nwhat was called the Last Mile at other prisons was called the Green Mile at Cold Mountain. It ran, I\\nguess, sixty long paces from south to north, bottom to top. At the bottom was the restraint room. At the\\ntop end was a T-junction. A left turn meant life-if you called what went on in the sunbaked exercise yard\\nlife, and many did; many lived it for years, with no apparent ill effects. Thieves and arsonists and sex\\ncriminals, all talking their talk and walking their walk and making their little deals.\\nA right turn, though - that was different. First you went into my office (where the carpet was also green,\\na thing I kept meaning to change and not getting around to), and crossed in front of my desk, which was\\nflanked by the American flag on the left and the state flag on the right. On the far side were two doors.\\nOne led into the small W.C. that I and the Block E guards (sometimes even Warden Moores) used; the\\nother opened on a kind of storage shed. This was where you ended up when you walked the Green Mile.\\nIt was a small door - I had to duck my head when I went through, and John Coffey actually had to sit and\\nscoot. You came out on a little landing, then went down three cement steps to a board floor. It was a\\nmiserable room without heat and with a metal roof, just like the one on the block to which it was an\\nadjunct. It was cold enough in there to see your breath during the winter, and stifling in the summer. At\\nthe execution of Elmer Manfred - in July or August of 30, that one was, I believe-we had nine witnesses\\npass out.\\nOn the left side of the storage shed - again - there was life. Tools (all locked down in frames\\ncriss-crossed with chains, as if they were carbine rifles instead of spades and pickaxes), dry goods, sacks\\nof seeds for spring planting in the prison gardens, boxes of toilet paper, pallets cross-loaded with blanks\\nfor the prison plate-shop... even bags of lime for marking out the baseball diamond and the football\\ngridiron - the cons played in what was known as The Pasture, and fall afternoons were greatly looked\\nforward to at Cold Mountain.\\nOn the right - once again - death. Old Sparky his ownself, sitting up on a plank platform at the southeast\\ncorner of the store room, stout oak legs, broad oak arms that had absorbed the terrorized sweat of scores\\nof men in the last few minutes of their lives, and the metal cap, usually hung jauntily on the back of the\\nchair, like some robot kids beanie in a Buck Rogers comic-strip. A cord ran from it and through a\\ngasket-circled hole in the cinderblock wall behind the chair. Off to one side was a galvanized tin bucket.\\nIf you looked inside it, you would see a circle of sponge, cut just right to fit the metal cap. Before\\nexecutions, it was soaked in brine to better conduct the charge of direct-current electricity that ran\\nthrough the wire, through the sponge, and into the condemned mans brain.\\n2.\\n\\n\\x0c1932 was the year of John Coffey. The details would be in the papers, still there for anyone who cared\\nenough to look them out - someone with more energy than one very old man whittling away the end of\\nhis life in a Georgia nursing home. That was\\na hot fall, I remember that; very hot, indeed. October almost like August, and the wardens wife, Melinda,\\nup in the hospital at Indianola for a spell. It was the fall I had the worst urinary infection of my life, not\\nbad enough to put me in the hospital myself, but almost bad enough for me to wish I was dead every time\\nI took a leak. It was the fall of Delacroix, the little half-bald Frenchman with the mouse, the one that\\ncame in the summer and did that cute trick with the spool. Mostly, though, it was the fall that John\\nCoffey came to E Block, sentenced to death for the rape-murder of the Detterick twins.\\nThere were four or five guards on the block each shift, but a lot of them were floaters. Dean Stanton,\\nHarry Terwilliger, and Brutus Howell (the men called him \"Brutal,\" but it was a joke, he wouldnt hurt a\\nfly unless he had to, in spite of his size) are all dead now, and so is Percy Wetmore, who really was\\nbrutal ... not to mention stupid. Percy had no business on E Block, where an ugly nature was useless and\\nsometimes dangerous, but he was related to the governor by marriage, and so he stayed.\\nIt was Percy Wetmore who ushered Coffey onto the block, with the supposedly traditional cry of \"Dead\\nman walking! Dead man walking here!\"\\nIt was still as hot as the hinges of hell, October or not. The door to the exercise yard opened, letting in a\\nflood of brilliant light and the biggest man Ive ever seen, except for some of the basketball fellows they\\nhave on the TV down in the \"Resource Room\" of this home for wayward droolers Ive finished up in. He\\nwore chains on his arms and across his water-barrel of a chest; he wore legirons on his ankles and\\nshuffled a chain between them that sounded like cascading coins as it ran along the lime - colored\\ncorridor between the cells. Percy Wetmore was on one side of him, skinny little Harry Terwilliger was on\\nthe other, and they looked like children walking along with a captured bear. Even Brutus Howell looked\\nlike a kid next to Coffey, and Brutal was over six feet tall and broad as well, a football tackle who had\\ngone on to play at LSU until he flunked out and came back home to the ridges.\\nJohn Coffey was black, like most of the men who came to stay for awhile in E Block before dying in Old\\nSparkys lap, and he stood six feet, eight inches tall. He wasnt all willowy like the TV basketball fellows,\\nthough - he was broad in the shoulders and deep through the chest, laced over with muscle in every\\ndirection. Theyd put him in the biggest denims they could find in Stores, and still the cuffs of the pants\\nrode halfway up on his bunched and scarred calves. The shirt was open to below his chest, and the\\nsleeves stopped somewhere on his forearms. He was holding his cap in one huge hand, which was just as\\nwell; perched on his bald mahogany ball of a head, it would have looked like the kind of cap an\\norgangrinders monkey wears, only blue instead of red. He looked like he could have snapped the chains\\nthat held him as easily as you might snap the ribbons on a Christmas present, but when you looked in his\\nface, you knew he wasnt going to do anything like that. It wasnt dull-although that was what Percy\\nthought, it wasnt long before Percy was calling him the ijit - but lost. He kept looking around as if to\\nmake out where he was. Maybe even who he was. My first thought was that he looked like a black\\nSamson ... only after Delilah had shaved him smooth as her faithless little hand and taken all the fun out\\nof him.\\n\"Dead man walking!\" Percy trumpeted, hauling on that bear of a mans wristcuff, as if he really believed\\nhe could move him if Coffey decided he didnt want to move anymore on his own. Harry didnt say\\nanything, but he looked embarrassed. \"Dead man---!\\n\\n\\x0cThatll be enough of that,\" I said. I was in what was going to be Coffeys cell, sitting on his bunk. Id\\nknown he was coming, of course, was there to welcome him and take charge of him, but had no idea of\\nthe mans pure size until I saw him. Percy gave me a look that said we all knew I was an asshole (except\\nfor the big dummy, of course, who only knew how to rape and murder little girls), but he didnt say\\nanything.\\nThe three of them stopped outside the cell door, which was standing open on its track. I nodded to Harry,\\nwho said: \"Are you sure you want to be in there with him, boss?\" I didnt often hear Harry Terwilliger\\nsound nervous - hed been right there by my side during the riots of six or seven years before and had\\nnever wavered, even when the rumors that some of them had guns began to circulate - but he sounded\\nnervous then.\\n\"Am I going to have any trouble with you, big boy?\" I asked, sitting there on the bunk and trying not to\\nlook or sound as miserable as I felt-that urinary infection I mentioned earlier wasnt as bad as it\\neventually got, but it was no day at the beach, let me tell you.\\nCoffey shook his head slowly - once to the left, once to the right, then back to dead center. Once his eyes\\nfound me, they never left me.\\nHarry had a clipboard with Coffeys forms on it in one hand. \"Give it to him,\" I said to Harry \"Put it in\\nhis hand.\"\\nHarry did. The big mutt took it like a sleepwalker.\\n\"Now bring it to me, big boy,\" I said, and Coffey did, his chains jingling and rattling. He had to duck his\\nhead just to enter the cell.\\nI looked up and down mostly to register his height as a fact and not an optical illusion. It was real: six\\nfeet, eight inches. His weight was given as two-eighty, but I think that was only an estimate; he had to\\nhave been three hundred and twenty, maybe as much as three hundred and fifty pounds. Under the space\\nfor scars and identifying marks, one word had been blocked out in the laborious printing of Magnusson,\\nthe old trusty in Registration: Numerous.\\nI looked up. Coffey had shuffled a bit to one side and I could see Harry standing across the corridor in\\nfront of Delacroixs cell - he was our only other prisoner in E Block when Coffey came in. Del was a\\nslight, balding man with the worried face of an accountant who knows his embezzlement will soon be\\ndiscovered. His tame mouse was sitting on his shoulder.\\nPercy Wetmore was leaning in the doorway of the cell which had just become John Coffeys. He had\\ntaken his hickory baton out of the custom-made holster he carried it in, and was tapping it against one\\npalm the way a man does when he has a toy he wants to use. And all at once I couldnt stand to have him\\nthere. Maybe it was the unseasonable heat, maybe it was the urinary infection heating up my groin and\\nmaking the itch of my flannel underwear all but unbearable, maybe it was knowing that the state had sent\\nme a black man next door to an idiot to execute, and Percy clearly wanted to hand-tool him a little first.\\nProbably it was all those things. Whatever it was, I stopped caring about his political connections for a\\nlittle while.\\n\"Percy.\" I said. \"Theyre moving house over in the infirmary.\"\\n\\n\\x0c\"Bill Dodge is in charge of that detail-\"\\n\"I know he is,\" I said. \"Go and help him.\"\\nThat isnt my job,\" Percy said. \"This big lugoon is my job.\" \"Lugoon\" was Percys joke name for the big\\nones - a combination of lug and goon. He resented the big ones. He wasnt skinny, like Harry Terwilliger,\\nbut he was short. A banty-rooster sort of guy, the kind that likes to pick fights, especially when the odds\\nare all their way. And vain about his hair. Could hardly keep his hands off it.\\n\"Then your job is done,\" I said. \"Get over to the infirmary.\"\\nHis lower lip pooched out. Bill Dodge and his men were moving boxes and stacks of sheets, even the\\nbeds; the whole infirmary was going to a new frame building over on the west side of the prison. Hot\\nwork, heavy lifting. Percy Wetmore wanted no part of either.\\n\"They got all the men they need,\" he said.\\n\"Then get over there and straw-boss,\" I said, raising my voice. I saw Harry wince and paid no attention.\\nIf the governor ordered Warden Moores to fire me for ruffling the wrong set of feathers, who was Hal\\nMoores going to put in my place? Percy? It was a joke. \"I really dont care what you do, Percy, as long as\\nyou get out of here for awhile!\\nFor a moment I thought he was going to stick and thered be real trouble, with Coffey standing there the\\nwhole time like the worlds biggest stopped clock. Then Percy rammed his billy back into its hand-tooled\\nholster-foolish damned vanitorious thing - and went stalking up the corridor. I dont remember which\\nguard was sitting at the duty desk that day-one of the floaters, I guess - but Percy must not have liked the\\nway he looked, because he growled, \"You wipe that smirk off your shitepoke face or Ill wipe it off for\\nyou\" as he went by. There was a rattle of keys, a momentary blast of hot sunlight from the exercise yard,\\nand then Percy Wetmore was gone, at least for the time being. Delacroixs mouse ran back and forth from\\none of the little Frenchmans shoulders to the other, his filament whiskers twitching.\\n\"Be still, Mr. Jingles,\" Delacroix said, and the mouse stopped on his left shoulder just as if he had\\nunderstood. \"Just be so still and so quiet.\" In Delacroixs lilting Cajun accent, quiet came out sounding\\nexotic and foreign - kwaht.\\n\"You go lie down, Del,\" I said curtly. \"Take you a rest. This is none of your business, either!\\nHe did as I said. He had raped a young girl and killed her, and had then dropped her body behind the\\napartment house where she lived, doused it with coal-oil, and then set it on fire, hoping in some muddled\\nway to dispose of the evidence of his crime. The fire had spread to the building itself, had engulfed it,\\nand six more people had died, two of them children. It was the only crime he had in him, and now he was\\njust a mild-mannered man with a worried face, a bald pate, and long hair straggling over the back of his\\nshirt-collar. He would sit down with Old Sparky in a little while, and Old Sparky would make an end to\\nhim ... but whatever it was that had done that awful thing was already gone, and now he lay on his bunk,\\nletting his little companion run squeaking over his hands. In a way, that was the worst; Old Sparky never\\nburned what was inside them, and the drugs they inject them with today dont put it to sleep. It vacates,\\njumps to someone else, and leaves us to kill husks that arent really alive anyway.\\nI turned my attention to the giant.\\n\\n\\x0c\"If I let Harry take those chains off you, are you going to be nice?\"\\nHe nodded. It was like his head-shake: down , up, back to center. His strange eyes looked at me. There\\nwas a kind of peace in them, but not a kind I was sure I could trust. I crooked a finger to Harry, who\\ncame in and unlocked the chains. He showed no fear now, even when he knelt between Coffeys\\ntreetrunk legs to unlock the ankle irons, and that eased me some. It was Percy who had made Harry\\nnervous, and I trusted Harrys instincts. I trusted the instincts of all my day-to-day E Block men, except\\nfor Percy.\\nI have a little set speech I make to men new on the block, but I hesitated with Coffey, because he seemed\\nso abnormal, and not just in his size.\\nWhen Harry stood back (Coffey had remained motionless during the entire unlocking ceremony, as\\nplacid as a Percheron), I looked up at my new charge, tapping on the clipboard with my thumb, and said:\\n\"Can you talk, big boy?\"\\n\"Yes, sir, boss, I can talk,\" he said. His voice was a deep and quiet rumble. It made me think of a freshly\\ntuned tractor engine. He had no real Southern drawl-he said I, not Ah-but there was a kind of Southern\\nconstruction to his speech that I noticed later. As if he was from the South, but not of it. He didnt sound\\nilliterate, but he didnt sound educated. In his speech as in so many other things, he was a mystery.\\nMostly it was his eyes that troubled me - a kind of peaceful absence in them, as if he were floating far,\\nfar away.\\n\"Your name is John Coffey.\"\\n\"Yes, sir, boss, like the drink only not spelled the same way.\"\\n\"So you can spell, can you? Read and write?\"\\n\"Just my name, boss,\" said he, serenely.\\nI sighed, then gave him a short version of my set speech. Id already decided he wasnt going to be any\\ntrouble. In that I was both right and wrong.\\n\"My name is Paul Edgecombe,\" I said. \"Im the E Block super - the head screw. You want something\\nfrom me, ask for me by name. If Im not here, ask this other, man - his name is Harry Terwilliger. Or you\\nask for Mr. Stanton or Mr. Howell. Do you understand that?\"\\nCoffey nodded.\\n\"Just dont expect to get what you want unless we decide its what you need - this isnt a hotel. Still with\\nme?\"\\nHe nodded again.\\n\"This is a quiet place, big boy - not like the rest of the prison. Its just you and Delacroix over there. You\\nwont work; mostly youll just sit. Give you a chance to think things over.\" Too much time for most of\\nthem, but I didnt say that. \"Sometimes we play the radio, if alls in order. You like the radio?\"\\nHe nodded, but doubtfully, as if he wasnt sure what the radio was. I later found out that was true, in a\\nway; Coffey knew things when he encountered them again, but in between he forgot. He knew the\\n\\n\\x0ccharacters on Our Gal Sunday, but had only the haziest memory of what theyd been up to the last time.\\n\"If you behave, youll eat on time, youll never see the solitary cell down at the far end, or have to wear\\none of those canvas coats that buttons up the back. Youll have two hours in the yard afternoons from\\nfour until six, except on Saturdays when the rest of the prison population has their flag football games.\\nYoull have your visitors on Sunday afternoons, if you have someone who wants to visit you. Do you,\\nCoffey?\"\\nHe shook his head. \"Got none, boss,\" he said.\\nWell, your lawyer, then!\\n\"I believe Ive seen the back end of him,\" he said. \"He was give to me on loan. Dont believe he could\\nfind his way up here in the mountains!\\nI looked at him closely to see if he might be trying a little joke, but he didnt seem to be. And I really\\nhadnt expected any different. Appeals werent for the likes of John Coffey, not back then; they had their\\nday in court and then the world forgot them until they saw a squib in the paper saying a certain fellow\\nhad taken a little electricity along about midnight. But a man with a wife, children, or friends to look\\nforward to on Sunday afternoons was easier to control, if control looked to be a problem. Here it didnt,\\nand that was good. Because he was so damned big.\\nI shifted a little on the bunk, then decided I might feel a little more comfortable in my nether parts if I\\nstood up, and so I did. He backed away from me respectfully, and clasped his hands in front of him.\\n\"Your time here can be easy or hard, big boy, it all depends on you. Im here to say you might as well\\nmake it easy on all of us, because it comes to the same in the end. Well treat you as right as you deserve.\\nDo you have any questions?\"\\n\"Do you leave a light on after bedtime?\" he asked right away, as if he had only been waiting for the\\nchance.\\nI blinked at him. I had been asked a lot of strange questions by newcomers to E Block - once about the\\nsize of my wifes tits-but never that one.\\nCoffey was smiling a trifle uneasily, as if he knew we would think him foolish but couldnt help himself.\\n\"Because I get a little scared in the dark sometimes,\" he said. \"If its a strange place.\"\\nI looked at him - the pure size of him - and felt strangely touched. They did touch you, you know; you\\ndidnt see them at their worst, hammering out their horrors like demons at a forge.\\n\"Yes, its pretty bright in here all night long,\" I said. \"Half the lights along the Mile burn from nine until\\nfive every morning.\" Then I realized he wouldnt have any idea of what I was talking about - he didnt\\nknow the Green Mile from Mississippi mud - and so I pointed. \"In the corridor.\"\\nHe nodded, relieved. Im not sure he knew what a corridor was, either, but he could see the 200-watt\\nbulbs in their wire cages.\\nI did something Id never done to a prisoner before, then - I offered him my hand. Even now I dont know\\nwhy. Him asking about the lights, maybe. It made Harry Terwilliger blink, I can tell you that. Coffey\\ntook my hand with surprising gentleness, my hand all but disappearing into his, and that was all of it. I\\n\\n\\x0chad another moth in my killing bottle. We were done.\\nI stepped out of the cell. Harry pulled the door shut on its track and ran both locks. Coffey stood where\\nhe was a moment or two longer, as if he didnt know what to do next, and then he sat down on his bunk,\\nclasped his giants hands between his knees, and lowered his head like a man who grieves or prays. He\\nsaid something then in his strange, almost Southern voice. I heard it with perfect clarity, and although I\\ndidnt know much about what hed done then - you dont need to know about what a mans done in order\\nto feed him and groom him until its time for him to pay off what he owes - it still gave me a chill.\\n\"I couldnt help-it, boss,\" he said. \"I tried to take it back, but it was too late!\\n3.\\n\"Youre going to have you some trouble with Percy,\" Harry said as we walked back up the hall and into\\nmy office. Dean Stanton, sort of my third in command - we didnt actually have such things, a situation\\nPercy Wetmore would have fixed up in a flash - was sitting behind my desk, updating the files, a job I\\nnever seemed to get around to. He barely looked up as we came in, just gave his little glasses a shove\\nwith the ball of his thumb and dived back into his paperwork.\\n\"I been having trouble with that peckerwood since the day he came here,\" I said, gingerly, pulling my\\npants away from my crotch and wincing. \"Did you hear what he was shouting when he brought that big\\ngaloot down?\"\\n\"Couldnt very well not,\" Harry said. \"I was there, you know.\"\\n\"I was in the john and heard it just fine,\" Dean said. He drew a sheet of paper to him, held it up into the\\nlight so I could see there was a coffee-ring as well as typing on it, and then tossed it into the waste\\nbasket. Dead man walking. Must have read that in one of those magazines he likes so much!\"\\nAnd he probably had. Percy Wetmore was a great reader of Argosy and Stag and Mens Adventure. There\\nwas a prison tale in every issue, it seemed, and Percy read them avidly, like a man doing research. It was\\nlike he was trying to find out how to act, and thought the information was in those magazines. Hed come\\njust after we did Anthony Ray, the hatchet-killer - and he hadnt actually participated in an execution yet,\\nalthough hed witnessed one from the switch-room.\\n\"He knows people,\" Harry said. \"Hes connected. Youll have to answer for sending him off the block,\\nand youll have to answer even harder for expecting him to do some real work.\"\\n\"I dont expect it,\" I said, and I didnt ... but I had hopes. Bill Dodge wasnt the sort to let a man just stand\\naround and do the heavy looking-on. \"Im more interested in the big boy, for the time being. Are we\\ngoing to have trouble with him?\"\\nHarry shook his head with decision.\\n\"He was quiet as a lamb at court down there in Trapingus County,\" Dean said. He took his little rimless\\nglasses off and began to polish them on his vest. \"Of course they had more chains on him than Scrooge\\nsaw on Marleys ghost, but he could have kicked up dickens if hed wanted. Thats a pun, son.\"\\n\"I know,\" I said, although I didnt. I just hate letting Dean Stanton get the better of me.\\n\"Big one, aint he?\" Dean said.\\n\\n\\x0c\"He is,\" I agreed. \"Monstrous big.\"\\n\"Probably have to crank Old Sparky up to Super Bake to fry his ass!\\n\"Dont worry about Old Sparky,\" I said absently. \"He makes the big uns little.\"\\nDean pinched the sides of his nose, where there were a couple of angry red patches from his glasses, and\\nnodded. \"Yep,\" he said. \"Some truth to that, all right.\"\\nI asked, \"Do either of you know where he came from before he showed up in ... Tefton? It was Tefton,\\nwasnt it?\"\\n\"Yep,\" Dean said. \"Tefton, down in Trapingus County. Before he showed up there and did what he did,\\nno one seems to know. He just drifted around, I guess. You might be able to find out a little more from\\nthe newspapers in the prison library, if youre really interested. They probably wont get around to\\nmoving those until next week.\" He grinned. \"You might have to listen to your little buddy bitching and\\nmoaning upstairs, though.\"\\n\"I might just go have a peek, anyway,\" I said, and later on that afternoon I did.\\nThe prison library was in back of the building that was going to become the prison auto shop - at least\\nthat was the plan. More pork in someones pocket was what I thought, but the Depression was on, and I\\nkept my opinions to myself - the way I should have kept my mouth shut about Percy, but sometimes a\\nman just cant keep it clapped tight. A mans mouth gets him in more trouble than his pecker ever could,\\nmost of the time. And the auto shop never happened, anyway - the next spring, the prison moved sixty\\nmiles down the road to Brighton. More backroom deals, I reckon. More barrels of pork. Wasnt nothing\\nto me.\\nAdministration had gone to a new building on the east side of the yard; the infirmary was being moved\\n(whose country-bumpkin idea it had been to put an infirmary on the second floor in the first place was\\njust another of lifes mysteries); the library was still partly stocked - not that it ever had much in it - and\\nstanding empty. The old building was a hot clapboard box kind of shouldered in between A and B\\nBlocks. Their bathrooms backed up on it and the whole building was always swimming with this vague\\npissy smell, which was probably the only good reason for the move. The library was L-shaped, and not\\nmuch bigger than my office. I looked for a fan, but they were all gone. It must have been a hundred\\ndegrees in there, and I could feel that hot throb in my groin when I sat down. Sort of like an infected\\ntooth. I know thats absurd, considering the region were talking about here, but its the only thing I could\\ncompare it to. It got a lot worse during and just after taking a leak, which I had done just before walking\\nover.\\nThere was one other fellow there after all - a scrawny old trusty named Gibbons dozing away in the\\ncorner with a Wild West novel in his lap and his hat pulled down over his eyes. The heat wasnt\\nbothering him, nor were the grunts, thumps, and occasional curses from the infirmary upstairs (where it\\nhad to be at least ten degrees hotter, and I hoped Percy Wetmore was enjoying it). I didnt bother him,\\neither, but went around to the short side of the L, where the newspapers were kept. I thought they might\\nbe gone along with the fans, in spite of what Dean had said. They werent, though, and the business about\\nthe Detterick twins was easily enough looked out; it had been front-page news from the commission of\\nthe crime in June right through the trial in late August and September.\\n\\n\\x0cSoon I had forgotten the heat and the thumps from upstairs and old Gibbonss wheezy snores. The\\nthought of those little nine-year-old girls - their fluffy heads of blonde hair and their engaging Bobbsey\\nTwins smiles - in connection with Coffeys hulking darkness was unpleasant but impossible to ignore.\\nGiven his size, it was easy to imagine him actually eating them, like a giant in a fairy tale. What he had\\ndone was even worse, and it was a lucky thing for him that he hadnt just been lynched right there on the\\nriverbank. If, that was, you considered waiting to walk the Green Mile and sit in Old Sparkys lap lucky.\\n4.\\nKing Cotton had been deposed in the South seventy years before all these things happened and would\\nnever be king again, but in those years of the thirties it had a little revival. There were no more cotton\\nplantations, but there were forty or fifty prosperous cotton farms in the southern part of our state. Klaus\\nDetterick owned one of them. By the standards of the nineteen-fifties he would have been considered\\nonly a rung above shirttail poor, but by those of the thirties he was considered well-to-do because he\\nactually paid his store bill in cash at the end of most months, and he could meet the bank presidents eyes\\nif they happened to pass on the street. The farmhouse was clean and commodious. In addition to the\\ncotton, there were the other two cs: chickens and a few cows. He and his wife had three children:\\nHoward. who was twelve or thereabouts, and the twin girls. Cora and Kathe.\\nOn a warm night in June of that year, the girls asked for and were given permission to sleep on the\\nscreen-enclosed side porch, which ran the length of the house. This was a great treat for them. Their\\nmother kissed them goodnight just shy of nine, when the last light had gone out of the sky. It was the\\nfinal time she saw either of them until they were in their coffins and the undertaker had repaired the\\nworst of the damage.\\nCountry families went to bed early in those days - \"soon as twas dark under the table,\" my own mother\\nsometimes said - and slept soundly. Certainly Klaus, Marjorie, and Howie Detterick did on the night the\\ntwins were taken. Klaus would almost certainly have been wakened by Bowser, the familys big old\\nhalf-breed collie, if he had barked, but Bowser didnt. Not that night, not ever again.\\nKlaus was up at first light to do the milking. The porch was on the side of the house away from the barn,\\nand Klaus never thought to look in on the girls. Bowsers failure to join him was no cause for alarm,\\neither. The dog held the cows and the chickens alike in great disdain, and usually hid in his doghouse\\nbehind the barn when the chores were being performed, unless called ... and called energetically, at that.\\nMarjorie came downstairs fifteen minutes or so after her husband had pulled on his boots in the\\nmudroom and tromped out to the barn. She started the coffee, then put bacon on to fry. The combined\\nsmells brought Howie down from his room under the eaves, but not the girls from the porch. She sent\\nHowie out to fetch them as she cracked eggs into the bacon grease. Klaus would want the girls out to get\\nfresh ones as soon as breakfast was over. Except no breakfast was eaten in the Detterick house that\\nmorning. Howie came back from the porch, white around the gills and with his formerly sleep-puffy eyes\\nnow wide open.\\n\"Theyre gone,\" he said.\\nMarjorie went out onto the porch, at first more annoyed than alarmed. She said later that she had\\nsupposed, if she had supposed anything, that the girls had decided to take a walk and pick flowers by the\\ndawns early light. That or some similar green-girl foolishness. One look, and she understood why Howie\\nhad been white.\\n\\n\\x0cShe screamed for Klaus - shrieked for him - and Klaus came on the dead run, his workboots whitened by\\nthe half-full pail of milk he had spilled on them. What he found on the porch would have jellied the legs\\nof the most courageous parent. The blankets in which the girls would have bundled themselves as the\\nnight drew on and grew colder had been cast into one comer. The screen door had been yanked off its\\nupper hinge and hung drunkenly out into the dooryard. And on the boards of both the porch and the steps\\nbeyond the mutilated screen door, there were spatters of blood.\\nMarjorie begged her husband not to go hunting after the girls alone, and not to take their son if he felt he\\nhad to go after them, but she could have saved her breath. He took the shotgun he kept mounted in the\\nmudroom high out of the reach of little hands, and gave Howie the .22 they had been saving for his\\nbirthday in July. Then they went, neither of them paying the slightest attention to the shrieking, weeping\\nwoman who wanted to know what they would do if they met a gang of wandering hobos or a bunch of\\nbad niggers escaped from the county farm over in Laduc. In this I think the men were right, you know.\\nThe blood was no longer runny, but it was only tacky yet, and still closer to true red than the maroon that\\ncomes when blood has well dried. The abduction hadnt happened too long ago. Klaus must have\\nreasoned that there was still a chance for his girls, and he meant to take it.\\nNeither one of them could track worth a damn - they were gatherers, not hunters, men who went into the\\nwoods after coon and deer in their seasons not because they much wanted to, but because it was an\\nexpected thing. And the dooryard around the house was a blighted patch of dirt with tracks all overlaid in\\na meaningless tangle. They went around the barn, and saw almost at once why Bowser, a bad biter but a\\ngood barker, hadnt sounded the alarm. He lay half in and half out of a doghouse which had been built of\\nleftover barnboards (there was a signboard with the word Bowser neatly printed on it over the curved\\nhole in the front - I saw a photograph of it in one of the papers), his head turned most of the way around\\non his neck. It would have taken a man of enormous power to have done that to such a big animal, the\\nprosecutor later told John Coffeys jury ... and then he had looked long and meaningfully at the hulking\\ndefendant, sitting behind the defense table with his eyes cast down and wearing a brand-new pair of\\nstate-bought bib overalls that looked like damnation in and of themselves. Beside the dog, Klaus and\\nHowie found a scrap of cooked link sausage. The theory - a sound one, I have no doubt - was that Coffey\\nhad first charmed the dog with treats, and then, as Bowser began to eat the last one, had reached out his\\nhands and broken its neck with one mighty snap of his wrists.\\nBeyond the barn was Dettericks north pasture, where no cows would graze that day. It was drenched\\nwith morning dew, and leading off through it, cutting on a diagonal to the northwest and plain as day,\\nwas the beaten track of a mans passage.\\nEven in his state of near-hysteria, Klaus Detterick hesitated at first to follow it. It wasnt fear of the man\\nor men who had taken his daughters; it was fear of following the abductors backtrail ... of going off in\\nexactly the wrong direction at a time when every second might count.\\nHowie solved that dilemma by plucking a shred of yellow cotton cloth from a bush growing just beyond\\nthe edge of the dooryard. Klaus was shown this same scrap of cloth as he sat on the witness stand, and\\nbegan to weep as he identified it as a piece of his daughter Kathes sleeping-shorts. Twenty yards beyond\\nit, hanging from the jutting finger of a juniper shrub, they found a piece of faded green cloth that\\nmatched the nightie Cora had been wearing when she kissed her ma and pa goodnight.\\nThe Dettericks, father and son, set off at a near-run with their guns held in front of them, as soldiers do\\nwhen crossing contested ground under heavy fire. If I wonder at anything that happened that day. it is\\n\\n\\x0cthat the boy, chasing desperately after his father (and often in danger of being left behind completely),\\nnever fell and put a bullet in Klaus Dettericks back.\\nThe farmhouse was on the exchange - another sign to the neighbors that the Dettericks were prospering,\\nat least moderately, in disastrous times - and Marjorie used Central to call as many of her neighbors that\\nwere also on the exchange as she could, telling them of the disaster which had fallen like a\\nlightning-stroke out of a clear sky, knowing that each call would produce overlapping ripples, like\\npebbles tossed rapidly into a stilly pond. Then she lifted the handset one last time, and spoke those words\\nthat were almost a trademark of the early telephone systems of that time, at least in the rural South:\\n\"Hello, Central, are you on the line?\"\\nCentral was, but for a moment could say nothing, that worthy woman was all agog. At last she managed,\\n\"Yes, maam. Mrs. Detterick, I sure am, oh dear sweet blessed Jesus, Im a-prayin right now that your\\nlittle girls are all right---!\\n\"Yes, thank you,\" Marjorie said. \"But you tell the Lord to wait long enough for you to put me through to\\nthe high sheriffs office down Tefton, all right?\"\\nThe Trapingus County high sheriff was a whiskeynosed old boy with a gut like a washtub and a head of\\nwhite hair so fine it looked like pipe-cleaner fuzz. I knew him well; hed been up to Cold Mountain\\nplenty of times to see what he called \"his boys\" off into the great beyond. Execution witnesses sat in the\\nsame folding chairs youve probably sat in yourself a time or two, at funerals or church suppers or\\nGrange bingo (in fact, we borrowed ours from the Mystic Tie No. 44 Grange back in those days), and\\nevery time Sheriff Homer Cribus sat down in one, I waited for the dry crack that would signal collapse. I\\ndreaded that day and hoped for it, both at the same time, but it was a day that never came. Not long after\\n- couldnt have been more than one summer after the Detterick girls were abducted - he had a heart attack\\nin his office, apparently while screwing a seventeen year-old black girl named Daphne Shurtleff. There\\nwas a lot of talk about that, with him always sporting his wife and six boys around so prominent come\\nelection time - those were the days when, if you wanted to run for something, the saying used to be \"Be\\nBaptist or be gone.\" But people love a hypocrite, you know - they recognize one of their own, and it\\nalways feels so good when someone gets caught with his pants down and his dick up and it isnt you.\\nBesides being a hypocrite, he was incompetent, the kind of fellow whod get himself photographed pet\\nthat point, running southeast through low, wooded hills where families named Cray and Robinette and\\nDuplissey still made their own mandolins and often spat out their own rotted teeth as they plowed; deep\\ncountryside where men were apt to handle snakes on Sunday morning and lie down in carnal embrace\\nwith their daughters on Sunday night. I knew their families; most of them had sent Sparky a meal from\\ntime to time. On the far side of the river, the members of the posse could see the June sun glinting off the\\nsteel rails of a Great Southern branch line. About a mile downstream to their right, a trestle crossed\\ntoward the coal-fields of West Green.\\nHere they found a wide trampled patch in the grass and low bushes, a patch so bloody that many of the\\nmen had to sprint back into the woods and relieve themselves of their breakfasts. They also found the rest\\nof Coras nightgown lying in this bloody patch, and Howie, who had held up admirably until then, reeled\\nback against his father and nearly fainted.\\nAnd it was here that Bobo Marchants dogs had their first and only disagreement of the day. There were\\nsix in all, two bloodhounds, two bluetick hounds, and a couple of those terrierlike mongrels border\\n\\n\\x0cSoutherners call coon hounds. The coonies wanted to go northwest, upstream along the Trapingus; the\\nrest wanted to go in the other direction, southeast. They got all tangled in their leads, and although the\\npapers said nothing about this part, I could imagine the horrible curses Bobo must have rained down on\\nthem as he used his hands - surely the most educated part of him - to get them straightened around again.\\nI have known a few hound-dog men in my time, and its been my experience that, as a class, they run\\nremarkably true to type.\\nBobo shortleashed them into a pack, then ran Cora Dettericks torn nightgown under their noses, to kind\\nof remind them what they were doing out on a day when the temperature would be in the mid-nineties by\\nnoon and the noseeums were already circling the heads of the possemen in clouds. The coonies took\\nanother sniff, decided to vote the straight ticket, and off they all went downstream, in full cry.\\nIt wasnt but ten minutes later when the men stopped, realizing they could hear more than just the dogs. It\\nwas a howling rather than a baying, and a sound no dog had ever made, not even in its dying extremities.\\nIt was a sound none of them had ever heard anything make, but they knew right away, all of them, that it\\nwas a man. So they said, and I believed them. I think I would have recognized it, too. I have heard men\\nscream just that way, I think, on their way to the electric chair. Not a lot - most button themselves up and\\ngo either quiet or joking, like it was the class picnic - but a few. Usually the ones who believe in hell as a\\nreal place, and know it is waiting for them at the end of the Green Mile.\\nBobo shortleashed his dogs again. They were valuable, and he had no intention of losing them to the\\npsychopath howling and gibbering just down yonder. The other men reloaded their guns and snapped\\nthem closed. That howling had chilled them all, and made the sweat under their arms and running down\\ntheir backs feel like icewater. When men take a chill like that, they need a leader if they are to go on, and\\nDeputy McGee led them. He got out in front and walked briskly (I bet he didnt feel very brisk right then,\\nthough) to a stand of alders that jutted out of the woods on the right, with the rest of them trundling along\\nnervously about five paces behind. He paused just once, and that was to motion the biggest man among\\nthem - Sam Hollis - to keep near Klaus Detterick.\\nOn the other side of the alders there was more open ground stretching back to the woods on the right. On\\nthe left was the long, gentle slope of the riverbank. They all stopped where they were, thunderstruck. I\\nthink they would have given a good deal to unsee what was before them, and none of them would ever\\nforget it - it was the sort of nightmare, bald and almost smoking in the sun, that lies beyond the drapes\\nand furnishings of good and ordinary lives - church suppers, walks along country lanes, honest work,\\nlove-kisses in bed. There is a skull in every man, and I tell you there is a skull in the lives of all men.\\nThey saw it that day, those men - they saw what sometimes grins behind the smile.\\nSitting on the riverbank in a faded, bloodstained jumper was the biggest man any of them had ever seen John Coffey. His enormous, splay-toed feet were bare. On his head he wore a faded red bandanna, the\\nway a country woman would wear a kerchief into church. Gnats circled him in a black cloud. Curled in\\neach arm was the body of a naked girl. Their blonde hair, once curly and light as milkweed fluff, was\\nnow matted to their heads and streaked red. The man holding them sat bawling up at the sky like a\\nmoonstruck calf, his dark brown cheeks slicked with tears, his face twisted in a monstrous cramp of grief\\nHe drew breath in hitches, his chest rising until the snaps holding the straps of his jumper were strained,\\nand then let that vast catch of air out in another of those howls. So often you read in the paper that \"the\\nkiller showed no remorse,\" but that wasnt the case here. John Coffey was torn open by what he had done\\n... but he would live. The girls would not. They had been torn open in a more fundamental way.\\n\\n\\x0cNo one seemed to know how long they stood there, looking at the howling man who was, in his turn,\\nlooking across the great still plate of the river at a train on the other side, storming down the tracks\\ntoward the trestle that crossed the river. It seemed they looked for an hour or for forever, and yet the train\\ngot no farther along, it seemed to storm only in one place, like a child doing a tantrum, and the sun did\\nnot go behind a cloud, and the sight was not blotted from their eyes. It was there before them, as real as a\\ndogbite. The black man rocked back and forth; Cora and Kathe rocked with him like dolls in the arms of\\na giant. The bloodstained muscles in the mans huge, bare arms flexed and relaxed, flexed and relaxed,\\nflexed and relaxed.\\nIt was Klaus Detterick who broke the tableau. Screaming, he flung himself at the monster who had raped\\nand killed his daughters. Sam Hollis knew his job and tried to do it, but couldnt. He was six inches taller\\nthan Klaus and outweighed him by at least seventy pounds, but Klaus seemed to almost shrug his\\nencircling arms off. Klaus flew across the intervening open ground and launched a flying kick at Coffeys\\nhead. His workboot, caked with spilled milk that had already soured in the heat, scored a direct hit on\\nCoffeys left temple, but Coffey seemed not to feel it at all. He only sat there, keening and rocking and\\nlooking out across the river; the way I imagine it, he could almost have been a picture out of some piney\\nwoods Pentecostal sermon, the faithful follower of the Cross looking out toward Goshen Land ... if not\\nfor the corpses, that was.\\nIt took four men to haul the hysterical farmer off John Coffey, and he fetched Coffey I dont know how\\nmany good licks before they finally did. It didnt seem to matter to Coffey, one way or the other; he just\\nwent on looking out across the river and keening. As for Detterick, all the fight went out of him when he\\nwas finally pulled off - as if some strange galvanizing current had been running through the huge black\\nman (I still have a tendency to think in electrical metaphors; youll have to pardon me), and when\\nDettericks contact with that power source was finally broken, he went as limp as a man flung back from\\na live wire. He knelt wide-legged on the riverbank with his hands to his face, sobbing. Howie joined him\\nand they hugged each other forehead to forehead.\\nTwo men watched them while the rest formed a rifle-toting ring around the rocking, wailing black man.\\nHe still seemed not to realize that anyone but him was there. McGee stepped forward, shifted uncertainly\\nfrom foot to foot for a bit, then hunkered.\\n\"Mister,\" he said in a quiet voice, and Coffey hushed at once. McGee looked at eyes that were bloodshot\\nfrom crying. And still they streamed, as if someone had left a faucet on inside him. Those eyes wept, and\\nyet were somehow untouched ... distant and serene. I thought them the strangest eyes I had ever seen in\\nmy life, and McGee felt much the same. \"Like the eyes of an animal that never saw a man before,\" he\\ntold a reporter named Hammersmith just before the trial.\\n\"Mister, do you hear me?\" McGee asked.\\nSlowly, Coffey nodded his head. Still he curled his arms around his unspeakable dolls, their chins down\\non their chests so their faces could not be clearly seen, one of the few mercies God saw fit to bestow that\\nday.\\n\"Do you have a name?\" MeGee asked.\\n\"John Coffey,\" he said in a thick and tear-clotted voice. \"Coffey like the drink, only not spelled the same\\nway.\"\\n\\n\\x0cMcGee nodded, then pointed a thumb at the chest pocket of Coffeys jumper, which was bulging. It\\nlooked to McGee like it might have been a gun - not that a man Coffeys size would need a gun to do\\nsome major damage, if he decided to go off. \"Whats that in there, John Coffey? Is that maybe a heater?\\nA pistol?\"\\n\"Nosir,\" Coffey said in his thick voice, and those strange eyes - welling tears and agonized on top, distant\\nand weirdly serene underneath, as if the true John Coffey was somewhere else, looking out on some\\nother landscape where murdered little girls were nothing to get all worked up about -never left Deputy\\nMcGees. \"Thats just a little lunch I have.\"\\n\"Oh, now, a little lunch, is that right?\" McGee asked, and Coffey nodded and said yessir with his eyes\\nrunning and dear snot-runners hanging out of his nose. \"And where did the likes of you get a little lunch,\\nJohn Coffey?\" Forcing himself to be calm, although he could smell the girls by then, and could see the\\nflies lighting and sampling the places on them that were wet. It was their hair that was the worst, he said\\nlater ... and this wasnt in any newspaper story; it was considered too grisly for family reading. No, this I\\ngot from the reporter who wrote the story, Mr. Hammersmith. I looked him up later on, because later on\\nJohn Coffey became sort of an obsession with me. McGee told this Hammersmith that their blonde hair\\nwasnt blonde anymore. It was auburn. Blood had run down their cheeks out of it like it was a bad\\ndye-job, and you didnt have to be a doctor to see that their fragile skulls had been dashed together with\\nthe force of those mighty arms. Probably they had been crying. Probably he had wanted to make them\\nstop. If the girls had been lucky, this had happened before the rapes.\\nLooking at that made it hard for a man to think, even a man as determined to do his job as Deputy\\nMcGee was. Bad thinking could cause mistakes, maybe more bloodshed. McGee drew him in a deep\\nbreath and calmed himself. Tried, anyway.\\nWellsir, I dont exactly remember, be dog if I do,\" Coffey said in his tear-choked voice, \"but its a little\\nlunch, all right, sammidges and I think a swee pickle.\"\\nI might just have a look for myself, its all the same to you,\" McGee said. \"Dont you move now, John\\nCoffey. Dont do it, boy, because there are enough guns aimed at you to make you disappear from the\\nwaist up should you so much as twitch a finger.\"\\nCoffey looked out across the river and didnt move as McGee gently reached into the chest pocket of\\nthose biballs and pulled out something wrapped in newspaper and tied with a hank of butchers twine.\\nMeGee snapped the string and opened the paper, although he was pretty sure it was just what Coffey said\\nit was, a little lunch. There was a bacon-tomato sandwich and a jelly fold-over. There was also a pickle,\\nwrapped in its own piece of a funny page John Coffey would never be able to puzzle out. There were no\\nsausages. Bowser had gotten the sausages out of John Coffeys little lunch.\\nMcGee handed the lunch back over his shoulder to one of the other men without taking his eyes off\\nCoffey. Hunkered down like that, he was too close to want to let his attention stray for even a second.\\nThe lunch, wrapped up again and tied for good measure, finally ended up with Bobo Marchant, who put\\nit in his knapsack, where he kept treats for his dogs (and a few fishing lures, I shouldnt wonder). It\\nwasnt introduced into evidence at the trial - justice in this part of the world is swift, but not as swift as a\\nbacon-tomato sandwich goes over - though photographs of it were.\\nWhat happened here, John Coffey?\" McGee asked in his low, earnest voice. \"You want to tell me that?\"\\n\\n\\x0cAnd Coffey said to McGee and the others almost exactly the same thing he said to me; they were also the\\nlast words the prosecutor said to the jury at Coffeys trial. \"I couldnt help it,\" John Coffey said, holding\\nthe murdered, violated girls naked in his arms. The tears began to pour down his cheeks again. \"I tried to\\ntake it back, but it was too late!\\n\"Boy, you are under arrest for murder,\" McGee said, and then he spit in John Coffeys face.\\nThe jury was out forty-five minutes. Just about time enough to eat a little lunch of their own. I wonder\\nthey had any stomach for it.\\n5.\\nI think you know I didnt find all that out during one hot October afternoon in the soon-to-be-defunct\\nprison library, from one set of old newspapers stacked in a pair of Pomona orange crates, but I learned\\nenough to make it hard for me to sleep that night. When my wife got up at two in the morning and found\\nme sitting in the kitchen, drinking buttermilk and smoking home-rolled Bugler, she asked me what was\\nwrong and I lied to her for one of the few times in the long course of our marriage. I said Id had another\\nrun-in with Percy Wetmore. I had, of course, but that wasnt the reason shed found me sitting up late. I\\nwas usually able to leave Percy at the office.\\nWell, forget that rotten apple and come on back to bed,\" she said. \"Ive got something thatll help you\\nsleep, and you can have all you want.\"\\n\"That sounds good, but I think wed better not,\" I said. \"Ive got a little something wrong with my\\nwaterworks, and wouldnt want to pass it on to you.\"\\nShe raised an eyebrow. \"Waterworks, huh,\" she said. \"I guess you must have taken up with the wrong\\nstreetcorner girl the last time you were in Baton Rouge.\" Ive never been in Baton Rouge and never so\\nmuch as touched a streetcorner girl, and we both knew it.\\n\"Its just a plain old urinary infection,\" I said. \"My mother used to say boys got them from taking a leak\\nwhen the north wind was blowing.\"\\n\"Your mother also used to stay in all day if she spilled the salt,\" my wife said. \"Dr Sadler-\"\\n\"No, sir,\" I said, raising my hand. \"Hell want me to take sulfa, and Ill be throwing up in every comer of\\nmy office by the end of the week. Itll run its course, but in the meantime, I guess we best stay out of the\\nplayground.\"\\nShe kissed my forehead right over my left eyebrow, which always gives me the prickles ... as Janice well\\nknew. \"Poor baby. As if that awful Percy Wetmore wasnt enough. Come to bed soon!\\nI did, but before I did, I stepped out onto the back porch to empty out (and checked the wind direction\\nwith a wet thumb before I did - what our parents tell us when we are small seldom goes ignored, no\\nmatter how foolish it may be). Peeing outdoors is one joy of country living the poets never quite got\\naround to, but it was no joy that night; the water coming out of me burned like a line of lit coal-oil. Yet I\\nthought it had been a little worse that afternoon, and knew it had been worse the two or three days before.\\nI had hopes that maybe I had started to mend. Never was a hope more ill-founded. No one had told me\\nthat sometimes a bug that gets up inside there, where its warm and wet, can take a day or two off to rest\\nbefore coming on strong again. I would have been surprised to know it. I would have been even more\\n\\n\\x0csurprised to know that, in another fifteen or twenty years, there would be pills you could take that would\\nsmack that sort of infection out of your system in record time ... and while those pills might make you\\nfeel a little sick at your stomach or loose in your bowels, they almost never made you vomit the way Dr.\\nSadlers sulfa pills did. Back in 32, there wasnt much you could do but wait, and try to ignore that\\nfeeling that someone had spilled coal-oil inside your works and then touched a match to it.\\nI finished my butt, went into the bedroom, and finally got to sleep. I dreamed of girls with shy smiles and\\nblood in their hair.\\n6.\\nThe next morning there was a pink memo slip on my desk, asking me to stop by the wardens office as\\nsoon as I could. I knew what that was about - there were unwritten but very important rules to the game,\\nand I had stopped playing by them for awhile yesterday - and so I put it off as long as possible. Like\\ngoing to the doctor about my waterworks problem, I suppose. Ive always thought this \"get-it-over-with\"\\nbusiness was overrated.\\nAnyway, I didnt hurry to Warden Mooress office. I stripped off my wool uniform coat instead, hung it\\nover the back of my chair, and turned on the fan in the corner - it was another hot one. Then I sat down\\nand went over Brutus Howells night-sheet. There was nothing there to get alarmed about. Delacroix had\\nwept briefly after turning in - he did most nights, and more for himself than for the folks he had roasted\\nalive, I am quite sure - and then had take Mr. Jingles, the mouse, out of the cigar box he slept in. That\\nhad calmed Del, and he had slept like a baby the rest of the night. Mr. Jingles had most likely spent it on\\nDelacroixs stomach, with his tail curled over his paws, eyes unblinking. It was as if God had decided\\nDelacroix needed a guardian angel, but had decreed in His wisdom that only a mouse would do for a rat\\nlike our homicidal friend from Louisiana. Not all that was in Brutals report, of course, but I had done\\nenough night watches myself to fill in the stuff between the lines. There was a brief note about Coffey:\\n\"Laid awake, mostly quiet, may have cried some. I tried to get some talk started, but after a few grunted\\nreplies from Coffey, gave up. Paul or Harry may have better luck.\"\\n\"Getting the talk started\" was at the center of our job, really. I didnt know it then, but looking back from\\nthe vantage point of this strange old age (I think all old ages seem strange to the folk who must endure\\nthem), I understand that it was, and why I didnt see it then - it was too big, as central to our work as our\\nrespiration was to our lives. It wasnt important that the floaters be good at \"getting the talk started,\" but\\nit was vital for me and Harry and Brutal and Dean... and it was one reason why Percy Wetmore was such\\na disaster. The inmates hated him, the guards hated him ... everyone hated him, presumably, except for\\nhis political connections, Percy himself, and maybe (but only maybe) his mother. He was like a dose of\\nwhite arsenic sprinkled into a wedding cake, and I think I knew he spelled disaster the start. He was an\\naccident waiting to happen. As for the rest of us, we would have scoffed at the idea that we functioned\\nmost usefully not as the guards of the condemned but as their psychiatrists part of me still wants to scoff\\nat that idea today - but we knew about getting the talk started . . . and without the talk, men facing Old\\nSparky had a nasty habit of going insane.\\nI made a note at the bottom of Brutals report to talk to John Coffey - to try, at least - and then passed on\\nto a note from Curtis Anderson, the wardens chief assistant. It said that he, Anderson, expected a DOE\\norder for Edward Delacrois (Andersons misspelling; the mans name was actually Eduard Delacroix)\\nvery soon. DOE stood for date of execution, and according to the note, Curtis had been told on good\\nauthority that the little Frenchman would take the walk shortly before Halloween - October 27th was his\\n\\n\\x0cbest guess, and Curtis Andersons guesses were very informed. But before then we could expect a new\\nresident, name of William Wharton. \"Hes what you like to call a problem child, \" Curtis had written  in\\nhis backslanting and somehow prissy script. \"Crazy-wild and proud of it. Has rambled all over the state\\nfor the last year or so, and has hit the big time at last. Killed three people in a holdup, one a pregnant\\nwoman, killed a fourth in the getaway. State Patrolman. All he missed was a nun and a blind man! I\\nsmiled a little at that. \"Wharton is 19 years old, has Billy the Kid tattooed on upper l. forearm. You will\\nhave to slap his nose a time or two, I guarantee you that, but be careful when you do it. This man just\\ndoesnt care.\" He had underlined this last sentiment twice, then finished: \"Also, he may be a\\nhang-arounder. Hes working appeals, and theres the fact that he is a minor.\"\\nA crazy kid, working appeals, apt to be around for awhile. Oh, that all sounded just fine. Suddenly the\\nday seemed hotter than ever, and I could no longer put off seeing Warden Moores.\\nI worked for three wardens during my years as a Cold Mountain guard; Hal Moores was the last and best\\nof them. In a walk. Honest, straightforward, lacking even Curtis Andersons rudimentary wit, but\\nequipped with just enough political savvy to keep his job during those grim years ... and enough integrity\\nto keep from getting seduced by the game. He would not rise any higher, but that seemed all right with\\nhim. He was fifty-eight or -nine back then, with a deeply lined bloodhound face that Bobo Marchant\\nprobably would have felt right at home with. He had white hair and his hands shook with some sort of\\npalsy, but he was strong. The year before, when a prisoner had rushed him in the exercise yard with a\\nshank whittled out of a crate-slat, Moores had stood his ground, grabbed the skatehounds wrist, and had\\ntwisted it so hard that the snapping bones had sounded like dry twigs burning in a hot fire. The\\nskatehound, all his grievances forgotten, had gone down on his knees in the dirt and begun screaming for\\nhis mother. \"Im not her,\" Moores said in his cultured Southern voice, \"But if I was, Id raise up my skirts\\nand piss on you from the loins that gave you birth.\"\\nWhen I came into his office, he started to get up and I waved him back down. I took the seat across the\\ndesk from him, and began by asking about his wife ... except in our part of the world, thats not how you\\ndo it. \"Hows that pretty gal of yours\" is what I asked, as if Melinda had seen only seventeen summers\\ninstead of sixty-two or -three. My concern was genuine he was a woman I could have loved and married\\nmyself, if the lines of our lives had coincided - but I didnt mind diverting him a little from his main\\nbusiness, either.\\nHe sighed deeply. \"Not so well, Paul. Not so well at all.\"\\n\"More headaches?\"\\n\"Only one this week, but it was the worst yet - put her flat on her back for most of the day before\\nyesterday. And now shes developed this weakness in her right hand-\" He raised his own liverspotted\\nright hand. We both watched it tremble above his blotter for a moment or two, and then he lowered it\\nagain. I could tell he would have given just about anything not to be telling me what he was telling me,\\nand I would have given just about anything not to be hearing it. Melindas headaches had started in the\\nspring, and all that summer her doctor had been saying they were \"nervous-tension migraines,\" perhaps\\ncaused by the stress of Hals coming retirement. Except that neither of them could wait for his retirement,\\nand my own wife had told me that migraine is not a disease of the old but the young; by the time its\\nsufferers reached Melinda Mooress age, they were usually getting better, not worse. And now this\\nweakness of the hand. It didnt sound like nervous tension to me; it sounded like a damned stroke.\\n\\n\\x0c\"Dr. Haverstrom wants her to go in hospital up to Indianola,\" Moores said. \"Have some tests. Head\\nX-rays, he means. Who knows what else. She is scared to death! He paused, then added, \"Truth to tell,\\nso am I.\"\\n\"Yeah, but you see she does it,\" I said. \"Dont wait. If it turns out to be something they can see with an\\nX-ray, it may turn out to be something they can fix.\"\\n\"Yes,\" he agreed, and then, for just a moment - the only one during that part of our interview, as I recall our eyes met and locked. There was the sort of nakedly perfect understanding between us that needs no\\nwords. It could be a stroke, yes. It could also be a cancer growing in her brain, and if it was that, the\\nchances that the doctors at Indianola could do anything about it were slim going on none. This was 32,\\nremember, when even something as relatively simple as a urinary infection was either sulfa and stink or\\nsuffer and wait.\\n\"I thank you for your concern, Paul. Now lets talk about Percy Wetmore!\\nI groaned and covered my eyes.\\n\"I had a call from the state capital this morning,\" the warden said evenly. \"It was quite an angry call, as\\nIm sure you can imagine. Paul, the governor is so married hes almost not there, if you take my meaning.\\nAnd his wife has a brother who has one child. That child is Percy Wetmore. Percy called his dad last\\nnight, and Percys dad called Percys aunt. Do I have to trace the rest of this out for you?\"\\nNo,\" I said. \"Percy squealed. Just like the schoolroom sissy telling teacher he saw Jack and Jill\\nsmooching in the cloakroom.\"\\n\"Yep,\" Moores agreed, \"thats about the size of it.\"\\n\"You know what happened between Percy and Delacroix when Delacroix came in?\" I asked. \"Percy and\\nhis damned hickory billy-club?\"\\n\"Yes, but - \"\\n\"And you know how he runs it along the bars sometimes, just for the pure hell of it. Hes mean, and hes\\nstupid, and I dont know how much longer I can take him. Thats the truth.\"\\nWed known each other five years. That can be a long time for men who get on well, especially when part\\nof the job is trading life for death. What Im saying is that he understood what I meant. Not that I would\\nquit; not with the Depression walking around outside the prison walls like a dangerous criminal, one that\\ncouldnt be caged as our charges were. Better men than me were out on the roads or riding the rods. I was\\nlucky and knew it - children grown and the mortgage, that two-hundred-pound block of marble, had been\\noff my chest for the last two years. But a mans got to eat, and his wife has to eat, too. Also, we were\\nused to sending our daughter and son-in-law twenty bucks whenever we could afford it (and sometimes\\nwhen we couldnt, if Janes letters sounded particularly desperate). He was an out-of-work high-school\\nteacher, and if that didnt qualify for desperate back in those days, then the word had no meaning. So no,\\nyou didnt walk off a steady paycheck job like mine ... not in cold blood, that was. But my blood wasnt\\ncold that fall. The temperatures outside were unseasonable, and the infection crawling around inside me\\nhad turned the thermostat up even more. And when a mans in that kind of situation, why, sometimes his\\nfist flies out pretty much of its own accord. And if you slug a connected man like Percy Wetmore once,\\nyou might as well just go right on slugging, because theres no going back.\\n\\n\\x0c\"Stick with it,\" Moores said quietly. \"Thats what I called you in here to say. I have it on good authority the person who called me this morning, in fact - that Percy has an application in at Briar, and that his\\napplication will be accepted.\"\\n\"Briar,\" I said. That was Briar Ridge, one of two state-run hospitals. Whats this kid doing? Touring state\\nfacilities?\"\\n\"Its an administration job. Better pay, and papers to push instead of hospital beds in the heat of the day.\"\\nHe gave me a slanted grin. \"You know, Paul, you might be shed of him already if you hadnt put him in\\nthe switch-room with Van Hay when The Chief walked.\"\\nFor a moment what he said seemed so peculiar I didnt have a clue what he was getting at. Maybe I didnt\\nwant to have a clue.\\n\"Where else would I put him?\" I asked. \"Christ, he hardly knows what hes doing on the block! To make\\nhim part of the active execution team - \" I didnt finish. Couldnt finish. The potential for screw-ups\\nseemed endless.\\n\"Nevertheless, youd do well to put him out for Delacroix. If you want to get rid of him, that is.\"\\nI looked at him with my jaw hung. At last I was able to get it up where it belonged so I could talk. \"What\\nare you saying? That he wants to experience one right up close where he can smell the guys nuts\\ncooking?\"\\nMoores shrugged. His eyes, so soft when he had been speaking about his wife, now looked flinty.\\n\"Delacroixs nuts are going to cook whether Wetmores on the team or not,\" he said. \"Correct?\"\\n\"Yes, but he could screw up. In fact, Hal, hes almost bound to screw up. And in front of thirty or so\\nwitnesses ... reporters all the way up from Louisiana . . .\"\\n\"You and Brutus Howell will make sure he doesnt,\" Moores said. \"And if he does anyway, it goes on his\\nrecord, and itll still be there long after his statehouse connections are gone. You understand?\"\\nI did. It made me feel sick and scared, but I did.\\n\"He may want to stay for Coffey, but if were lucky, hell get all he needs from Delacroix. You just make\\nsure you put him out for that one.\"\\nI had planned to stick Percy in the switch-room again, then down in the tunnel, riding shotgun on the\\ngurney that would take Delacroix to the meatwagon parked across the road from the prison, but I tossed\\nall those plans back over my shoulder without so much as a second look. I nodded. I had the sense to\\nknow it was a gamble I was taking, but I didnt care. If it would get rid of Percy Wetmore, Id tweak the\\ndevils nose. He could take part in his execution, clamp on the cap, and then look through the grille and\\ntell Van Hay to roll on two; he could watch the little Frenchman ride the lightning that he, Percy\\nWetmore, had let out of the bottle. Let him have his nasty little thrill, if thats what state-sanctioned\\nmurder was to him. Let him go on to Briar Ridge, where he would have his own office and a fan to cool\\nit. And if his uncle by marriage was voted out of office in the next election and he had to find out what\\nwork was like in the tough old sunbaked world where not all the bad guys were locked behind bars and\\nsometimes you got your own head whipped, so much the better.\\n\\n\\x0c\"All right,\" I said, standing up. \"Ill put him out front for Delacroix. And in the meantime, Ill keep the\\npeace.\"\\n\"Good,\" he said, and stood up himself. \"By the way, hows that problem of yours?\" He pointed delicately\\nin the direction of my groin.\\n\"Seems a little better.\"\\nWell, thats fine.\" He saw me to the door. \"What about Coffey, by the way? Is he going to be a\\nproblem?\"\\n\"I dont think so,\" I said. \"So far hes been as quiet as a dead rooster. Hes strange - strange eyes - but\\nquiet. Well keep tabs on him, though. Dont worry about that!\"\\n\"You know what he did, of course.\"\\n\"Sure.\"\\nHe was seeing me through to the outer office by then, where old Miss Hannah sat bashing away at her\\nUnderwood as she had ever since the last ice age had ended, it seemed. I was happy to go. All in all, I felt\\nas if Id gotten off easy. And it was nice to know there was a chance of surviving Percy, after all.\\n\"You send Melinda a whole basket of my love,\" I said. \"And dont go buying you an extra crate of\\ntrouble, either. Itll probably turn out to be nothing but migraine, after all.\"\\n\"You bet,\" he said, and below his sick eyes, his lips smiled. The combination was damned near ghoulish.\\nAs for me, I went back to E Block to start another day. There was paperwork to be read and written, there\\nwere floors to be mopped, there were meals to be served, a duty roster to be made out for the following\\nweek, there were a hundred details to be seen to. But mostly there was waiting - in prison theres always\\nplenty of that, so much it never gets done. Waiting for Eduard Delacroix to walk the Green Mile, waiting\\nfor William Wharton to arrive with his curled lip and Billy the Kid tattoo, and, most of all, waiting for\\nPercy Wetmore to be gone out of my life.\\n7.\\nDelacroixs mouse was one of Gods mysteries. I never saw one in E Block before that summer, and\\nnever saw one after that fall, when Delacroix passed from our company on a hot and thundery night in\\nOctober - passed from it in a manner so unspeakable I can barely bring myself to recall it. Delacroix\\nclaimed that he trained that mouse, which started its life among us as Steamboat Willy, but I really think\\nit was the other way around. Dean Stanton felt the same way, and so did Brutal. Both of them were there\\nthe night the mouse put in its first appearance, and as Brutal said, \"The thing us half-tame already, and\\ntwice as smart as that Cajun what thought he owned it.\"\\nDean and I were in my office, going over the record-box for the last year, getting ready to write\\nfollow-up letters to witnesses of five executions, and to write follow-ups to follow-ups in another six\\nstretching all the way back to 29. Basically, we wanted to know just one thing: were they pleased with\\nthe service? I know it sounds grotesque, but it was an important consideration. As taxpayers they were\\nour customers, but very special ones. A man or a woman who will turn out at midnight to watch a man\\ndie has got a special, pressing reason to be there, a special need, and if execution is a proper punishment,\\n\\n\\x0cthen that need ought to be satisfied. Theyve had a nightmare. The purpose of the execution is to show\\nthem that the nightmare is over. Maybe it even works that way. Sometimes.\\n\"Hey!\" Brutal called from outside the door, where he was manning the desk at the head of the hall. \"Hey,\\nyou two! Get out here!\"\\nDean and I gazed at each other with identical expressions of alarm, thinking that something had\\nhappened to either the Indian from Oklahoma (his name was Arlen Bitterbuck, but we called him The\\nChief ... or, in Harry Terwilligers case, Chief Coat Cheese, because that was what Harry claimed\\nBitterbuck smelled like), or the fellow we called The President. But then Brutal started to laugh, and we\\nhurried to see what was happening. Laughing in E Block sounded almost as wrong as laughing in church.\\nOld Toot-Toot, the trusty who ran the food-wagon in those days, had been by with his holy-rolling\\ncartful of goodies, and Brutal had stocked up for a long night - three sandwiches, two pops, and a couple\\nof moon pies. Also a side of potato salad Toot had undoubtedly filched from the prison kitchen, which\\nwas supposed to be off-limits to him. Brutal had the logbook open in front of him, and for a wonder he\\nhadnt spilled anything on it yet. Of course, he was just getting started.\\nWhat?\" Dean asked. \"What is it?\"\\n\"State legislature must have opened the pursestrings enough to hire another screw this year after all,\"\\nBrutal said, still laughing. \"Lookie yonder.\"\\nHe pointed and we saw the mouse. I started to laugh, too, and Dean joined in. You really couldnt help it,\\nbecause a guard doing quarter-hour check rounds was just like that mouse looked like: a tiny, furry guard\\nmaking sure no one was trying to escape or commit suicide. It would trot a little way toward us along the\\nGreen Mile, then turn its head from side to side, as if checking the cells. Then it would make another\\nforward spurt. The fact that we could hear both of our current inmates snoring away in spite of the\\nyelling and the laughter somehow made it even funnier.\\nIt was a perfectly ordinary brown mouse, except for the way it seemed to be checking into the cells. It\\neven went into one or two of them, skipping nimbly in between the lower bars in a way I imagine many\\nof our inmates, past and present, would envy. Except it was out that the cons would always be wanting to\\nskip, of course.\\nThe mouse didnt go into either of the occupied cells; only the empties. And finally it had worked its way\\nalmost up to where we were. I kept expecting it to turn back, but it didnt. It showed no fear of us at all.\\n\"It aint normal for a mouse to come up on people that way,\" Dean said, a little nervously. \"Maybe its\\nrabid.\"\\n\"Oh, my Christ,\" Brutal said through a mouthful of corned-beef sandwich. \"The big mouse expert. The\\nMouse Man. You see it foamin at the mouth, Mouse Man?\"\\n\"I cant see its mouth at all,\" Dean said, and that made us all laugh again. I couldnt see its mouth, either,\\nbut I could see the dark little drops that were its eyes, and they didnt look crazy or rabid to me. They\\nlooked interested and intelligent. Ive put men to death - men with supposedly immortal souls - that\\nlooked dumber than that mouse.\\nIt scurried up the Green Mile to a spot that was less than three feet from the duty desk ... which wasnt\\n\\n\\x0csomething fancy, like you might be imagining, but only the sort of desk the teachers used to sit behind up\\nat the district high school. And there it did stop, curling its tail around its paws as prim as an old lady\\nsettling her skirts.\\nI stopped laughing all at once, suddenly feeling cold through my flesh all the way to the bones. I want to\\nsay I dont know why I felt that way - no one likes to come out with something thats going to make them\\nlook or sound ridiculous - but of course I do, and if I can tell the truth about the rest, I guess I can tell the\\ntruth about this. For a moment I imagined myself to be that mouse, not a guard at all but just another\\nconvicted criminal there on the Green Mile, convicted and condemned but still managing to look bravely\\nup at a desk that must have seemed miles high to it (as the judgment seat of God will no doubt someday\\nseem to us), and at the heavy-voiced, blue-coated giants who sat behind it. Giants that shot its kind with\\nBB guns, or swatted them with brooms, or set traps on them, traps that broke their backs while they crept\\ncautiously over the word VICTOR to nibble at the cheese on the little copper plate.\\nThere was no broom by the duty desk, but there was a rolling mop-bucket with the mop still in the\\nwringer; Id taken my turn at swabbing the green lino and all six of the cells shortly before sitting down\\nto the record-box with Dean. I saw that Dean meant to grab the mop- and take a swing with it. I touched\\nhis wrist just as his fingers touched the slender wooden handle. \"Leave it be,\" I said.\\nHe shrugged and drew his hand back. I had a feeling he didnt want to swat it any more than I did.\\nBrutal tore a corner off his corned-beef sandwich and held it out over the front of the desk, tweezed\\ndelicately between two fingers. The mouse seemed to look up with an even livelier interest, as if it knew\\nexactly what it was. Probably did; I could see its whiskers twitch as its nose wriggled.\\n\"Aw, Brutal, no!\" Dean exclaimed, then looked at me. \"Dont let him do that, Paul! If hes gonna feed the\\ndamn thing, we might as well put out the welcome mat for anything on four legs.-\"\\n\"I just want to see what hell do,\" Brutal said. \"In the interests of science, like.\" He looked at me - I was\\nthe boss, even in such minor detours from routine as this. I thought about it and shrugged like it didnt\\nmatter much, one way or another. The truth was, I kind of wanted to see what hed do, too.\\nWell, he ate it - of course. There was a Depression on, after all. But the way he ate it fascinated us all. He\\napproached the fragment of sandwich, sniffed his way around it, and then he sat up in front of it like a\\ndog doing a trick, grabbed it, and pulled the bread apart to get at the meat. He did it as deliberately and\\nknowingly as a man tucking into a good roast-beef dinner in his favorite restaurant. I never saw an\\nanimal eat like that, not even a well-trained house dog. And all the while he was eating, his eyes never\\nleft us.\\n\"Either one smart mouse or hungry as hell,\" a new voice said. It was Bitterbuck. He had awakened and\\nnow stood at the bars of his cell, naked except for a pair of saggy-seated boxer shorts. A home-rolled\\ncigarette poked out from between the second and third knuckles of his right hand, and his iron-gray hair\\nlay over his shoulders - once probably muscular but now beginning to soften - in a pair of braids.\\n\"You got any Injun wisdom about micies, Chief?\" Brutal asked, watching the mouse eat. We were all\\npretty fetched by the neat way it held the bit of corned beef in its forepaws, occasionally turning it or\\nglancing at it, as if in admiration and appreciation.\\n\"Naw,\" Bitterbuck said. \"Knowed a brave once had a pair of what he claimed were mouse-skin gloves,\\n\\n\\x0cbut I didnt believe it!\" Then he laughed, as if the whole thing was a joke, and left the bars. We heard the\\nbunk creak as he lay down again.\\nThat seemed to be the mouses signal to go. It finished up what it was holding, sniffed at what was left\\n(mostly bread with yellow mustard soaking into it), and then looked back at us, as if it wanted to\\nremember our faces if we met again. Then it turned and scurried off the way it had come, not pausing to\\ndo any cell-checks this time. Its hurry made me think of the White Rabbit in Alices Adventures in\\nWonderland, and I smiled. It didnt pause at the door to the restraint room, but disappeared beneath it.\\nThe restraint room had soft walls, for people whose brains had softened a little. We kept cleaning\\nequipment stored in there when we didnt need the room for its created purpose, and a few books (most\\nwere westerns by Clarence Mulford, but one-loaned out only on special occasions - featured a profusely\\nillustrated tale in which Popeye, Bluto, and even Wimpy the hamburger fiend took turns shtupping Olive\\nOyl). There were craft items as well, including the crayons Delacroix later put to some good use. Not that\\nhe was our problem yet; this was earlier, remember. Also in the restraint room was the jacket no one\\nwanted to wear - white, made of double-sewn canvas, and with the buttons and snaps and buckles going\\nup the back. We all knew how to zip a problem child into that jacket lickety-larrup. They didnt get\\nviolent often, our lost boys, but when they did, brother, you didnt wait around for the situation to\\nimprove on its own.\\nBrutal reached into the desk drawer above the kneehole and brought out the big leather-bound book with\\nthe word VISITORS stamped on the front in gold leaf. Ordinarily, that book stayed in the drawer from\\none month to the next. When a prisoner had visitors - unless it was a lawyer or a minister - he went over\\nto the room off the messhall that was kept special for that purpose. The Arcade, we called it. I dont know\\nwhy.\\n\"Just what in the Gorry do you think youre doing?\" Dean Stanton asked, peering over the tops of his\\nspectacles as Brutal opened the book and paged grandly past years of visitors to men now dead.\\n\"Obeyin Regulation 19,\" Brutal said, finding the current page. He took the pencil and licked the tip - a\\ndisagreeable habit of which he could not be broken - and prepared to write. Regulation 19 stated simply:\\n\"Each visitor to E Block shall show a yellow Administration pass and shall be recorded without fail\"\\n\"Hes gone nuts,\" Dean said to me.\\n\"He didnt show us his pass, but Im gonna let it go this time,\" Brutal said. He gave the tip of his pencil an\\nextra lick for good luck, then filled in 9:49 p.m. under the column headed TIME ON BLOCK.\\n\"Sure, why not, the big bosses probably make exceptions for mice,\" I said.\\n\"Course they do,\" Brutal agreed. \"Lack of pockets.\" He turned to look at the wall-clock behind the desk,\\nthen printed 10:01 in the column headed TIME OFF BLOCK. The longer space between these two\\nnumbers was headed NAME OF VISITOR. After a moments hard thought - probably to muster his\\nlimited spelling skills, as Im sure the idea was in his head already - Brutus Howell carefully wrote\\nSTEAMBOAT WILLY, which was what most people called Mickey Mouse back in those days. It was\\nbecause of that first talkie cartoon, where he rolled his eyes and bumped his hips around and pulled the\\nwhistle cord in the pilothouse of the steamboat.\\n\"There,\" Brutal said, slamming the book closed and returning it to its drawer, \"all done and buttoned up.\"\\n\\n\\x0cI laughed, but Dean, who couldnt help being serious about things even when he saw the joke, was\\nfrowning and polishing his glasses furiously. \"Youll be in trouble if someone sees that.\" He hesitated and\\nadded, \"The wrong someone.\" He hesitated again, looking nearsightedly around almost as if he expected\\nto see that the walls had grown ears, before finishing: \"Someone like Percy\\nKiss-My-Ass-and-Go-to-Heaven Wetmore.\"\\n\"Huh,\" Brutal said. - The day Percy Wetmore sits his narrow shanks down here at this desk will be the\\nday I resign.\"\\n\"You wont have to,\" Dean said. \"Theyll fire you for making jokes in the visitors book if Percy puts the\\nright word in the right ear. And he can. You know he can!\\nBrutal glowered but said nothing. I reckoned that later on that night he would erase what he had written.\\nAnd if he didnt, I would.\\nThe next night, after getting first Bitterbuck and then The President over to D Block, where we showered\\nour group after the regular cons were locked down, Brutal asked me if we shouldnt have a look for\\nSteamboat Willy down there in the restraint room.\\n\"I guess we ought to,\" I said. Wed had a good laugh over that mouse the night before, but I knew that if\\nBrutal and I found it down there in the restraint room - particularly if we found it had gnawed itself the\\nbeginnings of a nest in one of the padded walls - we would kill it. Better to kill the scout, no matter how\\namusing it might be, than have to live with the pilgrims. And, I shouldnt have to tell you, neither of us\\nwas very squeamish about a little mouse-murder. Killing rats was what the state paid us for, after all.\\nBut we didnt find Steamboat Willy - later to be known as Mr. Jingles - that night, not nested in the soft\\nwalls, or behind any of the collected junk we hauled out into the corridor. There was a great deal of junk,\\ntoo, more than I would have expected, because we hadnt had to use the restraint room in a long time.\\nThat would change with the advent of William Wharton, but of course we didnt know that at the time.\\nLucky us.\\n\"Whered it go?\" Brutal asked at last, wiping sweat off the back of his neck with a big blue bandanna.\\n\"No hole, no crack ... theres that, but - \" He pointed to the drain in the floor. Below the grate, which the\\nmouse could have gotten through, was a fine steel mesh that not even a fly would have passed. \"Howd it\\nget in? Howd it get out?\"\\n\"I dont know,\" I said.\\n\"He did come in here, didnt he? I mean, the three of us saw him.\"\\n\"Yep, right under the door. He had to squeeze a little, but he made it.\"\\n\"Gosh,\" Brutal said - a word that sounded strange, coming from a man that big. \"Its a good thing the\\ncons cant make themselves small like that, isnt it?\"\\n\"You bet,\" I said, running my eye over the canvas walls one last time, looking for a hole, a crack,\\nanything. There was nothing. \"Come on. Lets go.\"\\nSteamboat Willy showed up again three nights later, when Harry Terwilliger was on the duty desk. Percy\\nwas also on, and chased the mouse back down the Green Mile with the same mop Dean had been\\n\\n\\x0cthinking of using. The rodent avoided Percy easily, slipping through the crack beneath the restraint-room\\ndoor a hands-down winner. Cursing at the top of his voice, Percy unlocked the door and hauled all that\\nshit out again. It was funny and scary at the same time, Harry said. Percy was vowing hed catch the\\ngoddam mouse and tear its diseased little head right off, but he didnt, of course. Sweaty and disheveled,\\nthe shirttail of his uniform hanging out in the back, he returned to the duty desk half an hour later,\\nbrushing his hair out of his eyes and telling Harry (who had sat serenely reading through most of the\\nruckus) that he was going to put a strip of insulation on the bottom of the door down there; that would\\nsolve the vermin problem, he declared.\\n\"Whatever you think is best, Percy,\" Harry said, turning a page of the oat opera he was reading. He\\nthought Percy would forget about blocking the crack at the bottom of that door, and he was right.\\n8.\\nLate that winter, long after these events were over, Brutal came to me one night when it was just the two\\nof us, E Block temporarily empty and all the other guards temporarily reassigned. Percy had gone on to\\nBriar Ridge.\\n\"Come here,\" Brutal said in a funny, squeezed voice that made me look around at him sharply. I had just\\ncome in out of a cold and sleety night, and had been brushing off the shoulders of my coat prior to\\nhanging it up.\\n\"Is something wrong?\" I asked.\\n\"No,\" he said, \"but I found out where Mr. Jingles was staying. When he first came, I mean, before\\nDelacroix took him over. Do you want to see?\"\\nOf course I did. I followed him down the Green Mile to the restraint room. All the stuff we kept stored\\nthere was out in the hall; Brutal had apparently taken advantage of the lull in customer traffic to do some\\ncleaning up. The door was open, and I saw our mop-bucket inside. The floor, that same sick lime shade\\nas the Green Mile itself, was drying in streaks. Standing in the middle of the floor was a stepladder, the\\none that was usually kept in the storage room, which also happened to serve as the final stop for the\\nstates condemned. There was a shelf jutting out from the back of the ladder near the top, the sort of thing\\na workman would use to hold his toolkit or a painter the bucket he was working out of. There was a\\nflashlight on it. Brutal handed it to me.\\n\"Get on up there. Youre shorter than me, so youll have to go pretty near all the way, but Ill hold your\\nlegs!\"\\n\"Im ticklish down there,\" I said, starting up. \"Especially my knees!\\n\"Ill mind that!\"\\n\"Good,\" I said, \"because a broken hips too high a price to pay in order to discover the origins of a single\\nmouse.\"\\n\"Huh?\"\\n\"Never mind.\" My head was up by the caged light in the center of the ceiling by then, and I could feel the\\nladder wiggling a little under my weight. Outside, I could hear the winter wind moaning. \"Just hold onto\\n\\n\\x0cme.\"\\n\"I got you, dont worry.\" He gripped my calves firmly, and I went up one more step. Now the top of my\\nhead was less than a foot from the ceiling, and I could see the cobwebs a few enterprising spiders had\\nspun in the crotches where the roof beams came together. I shone the light around but didnt see anything\\nworth the risk of being up here.\\nNo,\" Brutal said. \"Youre looking too far away, Paul. Look to your left, where those two beams come\\ntogether. You see them? Ones a little discolored!\\n\"I see.\"\\n\"Shine the light on the join!\"\\nI did, and saw what he wanted me to see almost right away. The beams had been pegged together with\\ndowels, half a dozen of them, and one was gone, leaving a black, circular hole the size of a quarter. I\\nlooked at it, then looked doubtfully back over my shoulder at Brutal. \"It was a small mouse,\" I said, \"but\\nthat small? Man, I dont think so.\"\\n\"But thats where he went,\" Brutal said. \"Im just as sure as houses.\"\\n\"I dont see how you can be.\"\\n\"Lean closer - dont worry I got you - and take a whiff.\"\\nI did as he asked, groping with my left hand for one of the other beams, and feeling a little better when I\\nhad hold of it. The wind outside gusted again; air puffed out of that hole and into my face. I could smell\\nthe keen breath of a winter night in the border South ... and something else, as well.\\nThe smell of peppermint.\\nDont let nothing happen to Mr. Jingles, I could hear Delacroix saying in a voice that wouldnt stay\\nsteady I could hear that, and I could feel the warmth of Mr. Jingles as the Frenchman handed it to me,\\njust a mouse, smarter than most of the species, no doubt, but still just a mouse for a that and a that. Dont\\nlet that bad un hurt my mouse, hed said, and I had promised, as I always promised them at the end when\\nwalking the Green Mile was no longer a myth or a hypothesis but something they really had to do. Mail\\nthis letter to my brother, who I havent seen for twenty years? I promise. Say fifteen Hail Marys for my\\nsoul? I promise. Let me die under my spirit-name and see that it goes on my tombstone? I promise. It was\\nthe way you got them to go and be good about it, the way you saw them into the chair sitting at the end\\nof the Green Mile with their sanity intact. I couldnt keep all of those promises, of course, but I kept the\\none I made to Delacroix. As for the Frenchman himself, there had been hell to pay. The bad un had hurt\\nDelacroix, hurt him plenty. Oh, I know what he did, all right, but no one deserved what happened to\\nEduard Delacroix when he fell into Old Sparkys savage embrace.\\nA smell of peppermint.\\nAnd something else. Something back inside that hole.\\nI took a pen out of my breast pocket with my right hand, still holding onto the beam with my left, not\\nworried anymore about Brutal inadvertently tickling my sensitive knees. I unscrewed the pens cap\\nonehanded, then poked the nib in and teased something out. It was a tiny splinter of wood which had\\n\\n\\x0cbeen tinted a bright yellow, and I heard Delacroixs voice again, so clearly this time that his ghost might\\nhave been lurking in that room with us - the one where William Wharton spent so much of his time.\\nHey, you guys! the voice said this time-the laughing, amazed voice of a man who has forgotten, at least\\nfor a little while, where he is and what awaits him. Come and see what Mr. Jingles can do!\\n\"Christ,\" I whispered. I felt as if the wind had been knocked out of me.\\n\"You found another one, didnt you?\" Brutal asked. \"I found three or four.\"\\nI came down and shone the light on his big, outstretched palm. Several splinters of wood were scattered\\nthere, like jackstraws for elves. Two were yellow, like the one I had found. One was green and one was\\nred. They hadnt been painted but colored, with wax Crayola crayons.\\n\"Oh, boy,\" I said in a low, shaky voice. \"Oh, hey. Its pieces of that spool, isnt it? But why? Why up\\nthere?\"\\n\"When I was a kid I wasnt big like I am now,\" Brutal said. \"I got most of my growth between fifteen and\\nseventeen. Until then I was a shrimp. And when I went off to school the first time, I felt as small as ...\\nwhy, as small as a mouse, I guess youd say. I was scared to death. So you know what I did?\"\\nI shook my head. Outside, the wind gusted again. In the angles formed by the beams, cobwebs shook in\\nfeathery drafts, like rotted lace. Never had I been in a place that felt so nakedly haunted, and it was right\\nthen, as we stood there looking down at the splintered remains of the spool which had caused so much\\ntrouble, that my head began to know what my heart had understood ever since John Coffey had walked\\nthe Green Mile: I couldnt do this job much longer. Depression, or no Depression, I couldnt watch many\\nmore men walk through my office to their deaths. Even one more might be too many.\\n\"I asked my mother for one of her hankies,\" Brutal said. \"So when I felt weepy and small, I could sneak\\nit out and smell her perfume and not feel so bad.\"\\n\"You think - what? - that mouse chewed off some of that colored spool to remember Delacroix by? That\\na mouse -\"\\nHe looked up. I thought for a moment I saw tears in his eyes, but I guess I was probably wrong about\\nthat. \"I aint saying nothing, Paul. But I found them up there, and I smelled peppermint, same as you you know you did. And I cant do this no more. I wont do this no more. Seeing one more man in that\\nchaird just about kill me. Im going to put in for a transfer to Boys Correctional on Monday. If I get it\\nbefore the next one, thats fine. If I dont, Ill resign and go back to farming.\"\\n\"What did you ever farm, besides rocks?\"\\n\"It dont matter.\"\\n\"I know it doesnt,\" I said. \"I think Ill put in with you.-\"\\nHe looked at me close, making sure I wasnt just having some sport with him, then nodded as if it was a\\nsettled thing. The wind gusted again, strong enough this time to make the beams creak and settle, and we\\nboth looked around uneasily at the padded walls. I think for a moment we could hear William Wharton not Billy the Kid, not him, he had been \"Wild Bill\" to us from his first day on the block - screaming and\\nlaughing, telling us we were going to be damned glad to be rid of him, telling us we would never forget\\n\\n\\x0chim. About those things he was right.\\nAs for what Brutal and I agreed on that night in the restraint room, it turned out just that way It was\\nalmost as if we had taken a solemn oath on those tiny bits of colored, wood. Neither of us ever took part\\nin another execution. John Coffey was the last.\\n\\nThe Green Mile\\nPart Two:\\nThe Mouse on the Mile\\n1.\\nThe nursing home where I am crossing my last bunch of ts and dotting my last mess of is is called\\nGeorgia Pines. Its about sixty miles from Atlanta and about two hundred light-years from life as most\\npeople - people under the age of eighty, lets say - live it. You who are reading this want to be careful that\\nthere isnt a place like it waiting in your future. Its not a cruel place, not for the most part; theres cable\\nTV, the foods good (although theres damned little a man can chew), but in its way, its as much of a\\nkilling bottle as E Block at Cold Mountain ever was.\\nTheres even a fellow here who reminds me a little of Percy Wetmore, who got his job on the Green Mile\\nbecause he was related to the governor of the state. I doubt if this fellow is related to anyone important,\\neven though he acts that way. Brad Dolan, his name is. Hes always combing his hair, like Percy was, and\\nhes always got something to read stuffed into his back pocket. With Percy it was magazines like Argosy\\nand Mens Adventure; with Brad its these little paperbacks called Gross jokes and Sick jokes. Hes\\nalways asking people why the Frenchman crossed the road or how many Polacks it takes to screw in a\\nlightbulb or how many pallbearers there are at a Harlem funeral. Like Percy, Brad is a dimwit who thinks\\nnothing is funny unless its mean.\\nSomething Brad said the other day struck me as actually smart, but I dont give him a lot of credit for it;\\neven a stopped clock is right twice a day, the proverb has it. \"Youre just lucky you dont have that\\nAlzheimers disease, Paulie,\" was what he said. I hate him calling me that, Paulie, but he goes on doing it,\\nanyway; Ive given up asking him to quit. There are other sayings - not quite proverbs - that apply to\\nBrad Dolan: \"You can lead a horse to water but you cant make him drink\" is one; \"You can dress him up\\nbut you cant take him out\" is another. In his thickheadedness he is also like Percy.\\nWhen he made his comment about Alzheimers, he was mopping the floor of the solarium, where I had\\nbeen going over the pages I have already written. Theres a great lot of them, and I think theres apt to be\\na great lot more before I am through. \"That Alzheimers, do you know what it really is?\"\\n\"No,\" I said, - but Im sure youll tell me, Brad.\"\\n\"Its AIDS for old people,\" he said, and then burst out laughing, hucka-hucka-hucka-huck!, just like he\\ndoes over those idiotic jokes of his.\\n\\n\\x0cI didnt laugh, though, because what he said struck a nerve somewhere. Not that I have Alzheimers;\\nalthough theres plenty of it on view here at beautiful Georgia Pines, I myself just suffer the standard\\noldguy memory problems. Those problems seem to have more to do with when than what. Looking over\\nwhat I have written so far, it occurs to me that I remember everything that happened back in 32; its the\\norder of events that sometimes gets confused in my head. Yet, if Im careful, I think I can keep even that\\nsorted out. More or less.\\nJohn Coffey came to E Block and the Green Mile in October of that year, condemned for the murder of\\nthe nine-year-old Detterick twins. Thats my major landmark, and if I keep it in view, I should do just\\nfine. William Wild Bill\" Wharton came after Coffey; Delacroix came before. So did the mouse, the one\\nBrutus Howell - Brutal, to his friends - called Steamboat Willy and Delacroix ended up calling Mr.\\nJingles.\\nWhatever you called him, the mouse came first, even before Del - it was still summer when he showed\\nup, and we had two other prisoners on the Green Mile: The Chief, Arlen Bitterbuck; and The Pres,\\nArthur Flanders.\\nThat mouse. That goddam mouse. Delacroix loved it, but Percy Wetmore sure didnt.\\nPercy hated it from the first.\\n2.\\nThe mouse came back just about three days after Percy had chased it down the Green Mile that first time.\\nDean Stanton and Bill Dodge were talking politics, which meant in those days, they were talking\\nRoosevelt and Hoover - Herbert, not J. Edgar. They were eating Ritz crackers from a box Dean had\\npurchased from old Toot-Toot an hour or so before. Percy was standing in the office doorway, practicing\\nquick draws with the baton he loved so much, as he listened. Hed pull it out of that ridiculous handtooled\\nholster hed gotten somewhere, then twirl it (or try to; most times he would have dropped it if not for the\\nrawhide loop he kept on his wrist), then re-holster it. I was off that night, but got the full report from\\nDean the following evening.\\nThe mouse came up the Green Mile just as it had before, hopping along, then stopping and seeming to\\ncheck the empty cells. After a bit of that it would hop on, undiscouraged, as if it had known all along it\\nwould be a long search, and it was up to that.\\nThe President was awake this time, standing at his cell door. That guy was a piece of work, managing to\\nlook natty even in his prison blues. We knew just by the way he looked that he wasnt made for Old\\nSparky, and we were right - less than a week after Percys second run at that mouse, The Press sentence\\nwas commuted to life and he joined the general population.\\n\"Say!\" he called. Theres a mouse in here! What kind of a joint are you guys running, anyway?\" He was\\nkind of laughing, but Dean said he also sounded kind of outraged, as if even a murder rap hadnt been\\nquite enough to knock the Kiwanis out of his soul. He had been the regional head of an outfit called\\nMid-South Realty Associates, and had thought himself smart enough to be able to get away with pushing\\nhis half-senile father out a third-story window and collect on a double-indemnity whole-life policy. On\\nthat he had been wrong, but maybe not by much.\\n\"Shut up, you lugoon,\" Percy said, but that was pretty much automatic. He had his eye on the mouse. He\\n\\n\\x0chad re-holstered his baton and taken out one of his magazines, but now he tossed the magazine on the\\nduty desk and pulled the baton out of its holster again. He began tapping it casually against the knuckles\\nof his left hand.\\n\"Son of a bitch,\" Bill Dodge said. \"Ive never seen a mouse in here before.\"\\n\"Aw, hes sort of cute,\" Dean said. \"And not afraid at all.\"\\n\"How do you know?\"\\n\"He was in the other night. Percy saw him, too. Brutal calls him Steamboat Willy.\"\\nPercy kind of sneered at that, but for the time being said nothing. He was tapping the baton faster now on\\nthe back of his hand.\\n\"Watch this,\" Dean said. \"He came all the way up to the desk before. I want to see if hell do it again.\"\\nIt did, skirting wide of The Pres on its way, as if it didnt like the way our resident parricide smelled. It\\nchecked two of the empty cells, even ran up onto one of the bare, unmattressed cots for a sniff, then came\\nback to the Green Mile. And Percy standing there the whole time, tapping and tapping, not talking for a\\nchange, wanting to make it sorry for coming back. Wanting to teach it a lesson.\\n\"Good thing you guys dont have to put him in Sparky,\" Bill said, interested in spite of himself. \"Youd\\nhave a hell of a time getting the clamps and the cap on.\"\\nPercy said nothing still, but he very slowly gripped the baton between his fingers, the way a man would\\nhold a good cigar.\\nThe mouse stopped where it had before, no more than three feet from the duty desk, looking up at Dean\\nlike a prisoner before the bar. It glanced up at Bill for a moment, then switched its attention back to\\nDean. Percy it hardly seemed to notice at all.\\n\"Hes a brave little barstid, I got to give him that,\" Bill said. He raised his voice a little. \"Hey! Hey!\\nSteamboat Willy!\"\\nThe mouse flinched a little and fluttered its ears, but it didnt run, or even show any signs of wanting to.\\n\"Now watch this,\" Dean said, remembering how Brutal had fed it some of his corned-beef sandwich. \"I\\ndont know if hell do it again, but-\"\\nHe broke off a piece of Ritz cracker and dropped it in front of the mouse. It just looked with its sharp\\nblack eyes at the orangey fragment for a second or two, its filament-fine whiskers twitching as it sniffed.\\nThen it reached out, took the cracker in its paws, sat up, and began to eat.\\n\"Well. Ill be shucked and boiled!\" Bill exclaimed. \"Eats as neat as a parson on parish house Saturday\\nnight!\"\\n\"Looks more like a nigger eating watermelon to me.\". Percy remarked, but neither guard paid him any\\nmind. Neither did The Chief or The Pres, for that matter. The mouse finished the cracker but continued to\\nsit, seemingly balanced on the talented coil of its tail, looking up at the giants in blue.\\n\"Lemme try,\" Bill said. He broke off another piece of cracker, leaned over the front of the desk, and\\n\\n\\x0cdropped it carefully. The mouse sniffed but did not touch.\\n\"Huh,\" Bill said. \"Must be full.\"\\n\"Nah,\" Dean said, \"he knows youre a floater, thats all.\"\\n\"Floater, am I? I like that! Im here almost as much as Harry Terwilliger! Maybe more!\"\\n\"Simmer down, old-timer, simmer down,\" Dean said, grinning. \"But watch and see if Im not right.\" He\\nbombed another piece of cracker over the side. Sure enough, the mouse picked that one up and began to\\neat again, still ignoring Bill Dodges contribution completely. But before it had done more than take a\\npreliminary nibble or two, Percy threw his baton at it, launching it like a spear.\\nThe mouse was a small target, and give the devil his due-it was a wickedly good shot, and might have\\ntaken \"Willys\" head clean off, if its reflexes hadnt been as sharp as shards of broken glass. It ducked yes, just as a human being would have - and dropped the chunk of cracker. The heavy hickory baton\\npassed over its head and spine close enough so its fur ruffled (thats what Dean said, anyway, and so I\\npass it on, although Im not sure I really believe it), then hit the green linoleum and bounced against the\\nbars of an empty cell. The mouse didnt wait to see if it was a mistake; apparently remembering a\\npressing engagement elsewhere, it turned and was off down the corridor toward the restraint room in a\\nflash.\\nPercy roared with frustration - he knew how close he had come - and chased after it again. Bill Dodge\\ngrabbed at his arm, probably out of simple instinct, but Percy pulled away from him. Still, Dean said, it\\nwas probably that grab which saved Steamboat Willys life, and it was still a near thing. Percy wanted not\\njust to kill the mouse but to squash it, so he ran in big, comical leaps, like a deer, stamping down with his\\nheavy black workshoes. The mouse barely avoided Percys last two jumps, first zigging and then zagging.\\nIt went under the door with a final flick of its long pink tail, and so long, stranger - it was gone.\\n\"Fuck!\" Percy said, and slammed the flat of his hand against the door. Then he began to sort through his\\nkeys, meaning to go into the restraint room and continue the chase.\\nDean came down the corridor after him, deliberately walking slow in order to get his emotions under\\ncontrol. Part of him wanted to laugh at Percy, he told me, but part of him wanted to grab the man, whirl\\nhim around, pin him against the restraint-room door, and whale the living daylights out of him. Most of\\nit, of course, was just being startled; our job on E Block was to keep rumpus to a minimum, and rumpus\\nwas practically Percy Wetmores middle name. Working with him was sort of like trying to defuse a\\nbomb with somebody standing behind you and every now and then clashing a pair of cymbals together.\\nIn a word, upsetting. Dean said he could see that upset in Arlen Bitterbucks eyes ... even in The\\nPresidents eyes, although that gentleman was usually as cool as the storied cucumber.\\nAnd there was something else, as well. In some part of his mind, Dean had already begun to accept the\\nmouse as - well, maybe not as a friend, but as a part of life on the block. That made what Percy had done\\nand what he was trying to do not right. Not even if it was a mouse he was trying to do it to. And the fact\\nthat Percy would never understand how come it wasnt right was pretty much the perfect example of why\\nhe was all wrong for the job he thought he was doing.\\nBy the time Dean reached the end of the corridor, he had gotten himself under control again, and knew\\nhow he wanted to handle the matter. The one thing Percy absolutely couldnt stand was to look foolish,\\n\\n\\x0cand we all knew it.\\n\"Coises, foiled again,\" he said, grinning a little, kidding Percy along.\\nPercy gave him an ugly look and flicked his hair off his brow. \"Match your mouth, Four-Eyes. Im riled.\\nDont make it worse!\"\\n\"So its moving day again, is it?\" Dean said, not quite laughing ... but laughing with his eyes. \"Well,\\nwhen you get everything out this time, would you mind mopping the floor?\"\\nPercy looked at the door. Looked at his keys. Thought about another long, hot, fruitless rummage in the\\nroom with the soft walls while they all stood around and watched him ... The Chief and The Pres, too.\\n\"Ill be damned if I understand whats so funny,\" he said. \"We dont need mice in the cellblock - we got\\nenough vermin in here already, without adding mice.\"\\n\"Whatever you say, Percy,\" Dean said, holding up his hands. He had a moment right there, he told me the\\nnext night, when he believed Percy might just take after him.\\nBill Dodge strolled up then and smoothed it over. \"Think you dropped this,\" he said, and handed Percy\\nhis baton. \"An inch lower, you woulda broken the little barstids back.\"\\nPercys chest expanded at that. \"Yeah, it wasnt a bad shot , \" he said, carefully re-seating his\\nheadknocker in its foolish holster. \"I used to be a pitcher in high school. Threw two no-hitters.\"\\n\"Is that right, now?\" Bill said, and the respectful tone of voice (although he winked at Dean when Percy\\nturned away) was enough to finish defusing the situation.\\n\"Yep,\" Percy said. \"Threw one down in Knoxville. Those city boys didnt know what hit em. Walked\\ntwo. Could have had a perfect game if the ump hadnt been such a lugoon.\"\\nDean could have left it at that, but he had seniority on Percy and part of a seniors job is to instruct, and at\\nthat time - before Coffey, before Delacroix - he still thought Percy might be teachable. So he reached out\\nand grasped the younger mans wrist. \"You want to think about what you was doing just now,\" Dean\\nsaid. His intention, he said later, was to sound serious but not disapproving. Not too disapproving,\\nanyway.\\nExcept with Percy, that didnt work. He might not learn ... but we would eventually.\\n\"Say, Four-Eyes, I know what I was doing - trying to get that mouse! Whatre you, blind?\"\\n\"You also scared the cheese out of Bill, out of me, and out of them,\" Dean said, pointing in the direction\\nof Bitterbuck and Flanders.\\n\"So what?\" Percy asked, drawing himself up. \"They aint in cradle-school, in case you didnt notice.\\nAlthough you guys treat them that way half the time.\"\\n\"Well, I dont like to be scared,\" Bill rumbled, \"and I work here, Wetmore, in case you didnt notice. I\\naint one of your lugoons.\"\\nPercy gave him a look that was narrow-eyed and a touch uncertain.\\n\\n\\x0c\"And we dont scare them any more than we have to, because theyre under a lot of strain,\" Dean said. He\\nwas still keeping his voice low. \"Men that are under a lot of strain can snap. Hurt themselves. Hurt\\nothers. Sometimes get folks like us in trouble, too.\"\\nPercys mouth twitched at that. \"In trouble\" was an idea that had power over him. Making trouble was\\nokay. Getting into it was not.\\n\"Our job is talking, not yelling,\" Dean said. \"A man who is yelling at prisoners is a man who has lost\\ncontrol.\"\\nPercy knew who had written that scripture - me.\\nThe boss. There was no love lost between Percy Wetmore and Paul Edgecombe, and this was still\\nsummer, remember - long before the real festivities started.\\n\"Youll do better,\" Dean said, \"if you think of this place as like an intensive-care ward in a hospital. Its\\nbest to be quiet--!\"\\n\"I think of it as a bucket of piss to drown rats in,\" Percy said, \"and thats all. Now let me go.\"\\nHe tore free of Deans hand, stepped between him and Bill, and stalked up the corridor with his head\\ndown. He walked a little too close to The Presidents side - close enough so that Flanders could have\\nreached out, grabbed him, and maybe headwhipped him with his own prized hickory baton, had Flanders\\nbeen that sort of man. He wasnt, of course, but The Chief perhaps was. The Chief, if given a chance,\\nmight have administered such a beating just to teach Percy a lesson. What Dean said to me on that\\nsubject when he told me this story the following night has stuck with me ever since, because it turned out\\nto be a kind of prophecy. \"Wetmore dont understand that he hasnt got any power over them,\" Dean said.\\n\"That nothing he does can really make things worse for them, that they can only be electrocuted once.\\nUntil he gets his head around that, hes going to be a danger to himself and to everyone else down here.\"\\nPercy went into my office and slammed the door behind him.\\n\"My, my,\" Bill Dodge said. \"Aint he the swollen and badly infected testicle.\"\\n\"You dont know the half of it,\" Dean said.\\n\"Oh, look on the bright side,\" Bill said. He was always telling people to look on the bright side; it got so\\nyou wanted to punch his nose every time it came out of his mouth. \"Your trick mouse got away, at least.\"\\n\"Yeah, but we wont see him no more,\" Dean said. \"I imagine this time goddam Percy Wetmores scared\\nhim off for good.\"\\n3.\\nThat was logical but wrong. The mouse was back the very next evening, which just happened to be the\\nfirst of Percy Wetmores two nights off before he slid over to the graveyard shift.\\nSteamboat Willy showed up around seven oclock. I was there to see his reappearance; so was Dean.\\nHarry Terwilliger, too. Harry was on the desk. I was technically on days, but had stuck around to spend\\nan extra hour with The Chief, whose time was getting close by then. Bitterbuck was stoical on the\\noutside, in the tradition of his tribe, but I could see his fear of the end growing inside him like a poison\\n\\n\\x0cflower. So we talked. You could talk to them in the daytime but it wasnt so good, with the shouts and\\nconversation (not to mention the occasional fist-fight) coming from the exercise yard, the\\nchonk-chonk-chonk of the stamping machines in the plate-shop, the occasional yell of a guard for\\nsomeone to put down that pick or grab up that hoe or just to get your ass over here, Harvey. After four it\\ngot a little better, and after six it got better still. Six to eight was the optimum time. After that you could\\nsee the long thoughts starting to steal over their minds again - in their eyes you could see it, like\\nafternoon shadows and it was best to stop. They still heard what you were saying, but it no longer made\\nsense to them. Past eight they were getting ready for the watches of the night and imagining how the cap\\nwould feel when it was clamped to the tops of their heads, and how the air would smell inside the black\\nbag which had been rolled down over their sweaty faces.\\nBut I got The Chief at a good time. He told me about his first wife, and how they had built a lodge\\ntogether up in Montana. Those had been the happiest days of his life, he said. The water was so pure and\\nso cold that it felt like your mouth was cut every time you drank.\\n\"Hey, Mr. Edgecombe,\" he said. \"You think, if a man he sincerely repent of what he done wrong, he\\nmight get to go back to the time that was happiest for him and live there forever? Could that be what\\nheaven is like?\"\\n\"Ive just about believed that very thing,\" I said, which was a he I didnt regret in the least. I had learned\\nof matters eternal at my mothers pretty knee, and what I believed is what the Good Book says about\\nmurderers: that there is no eternal life in them. I think they go straight to hell, where they burn in torment\\nuntil God finally gives Gabriel the nod to blow the Judgment Trump. When he does, theyll wink out ...\\nand probably glad to go they will be. But I never gave a hint of such beliefs to Bitterbuck, or to any of\\nthem. I think in their hearts they knew it. Where is your brother, his blood crieth to me from the ground,\\nGod said to Cain, and I doubt if the words were much of a surprise to that particular problem-child; I bet\\nhe heard Abels blood whining out of the earth at him with each step he took.\\nThe Chief was smiling when I left, perhaps thinking about his lodge in Montana and his wife lying\\nbare-breasted in the light of the fire. He would be walking in a warmer fire soon, I had no doubt.\\nI went back up the corridor, and Dean told me about his set-to with Percy the previous night. I think hed\\nwaited around just so he could, and I listened carefully. I always listened carefully when the subject was\\nPercy, because I agreed with Dean a hundred per cent - I thought Percy was the sort of man who could\\ncause a lot of trouble, as much for the rest of us as for himself.\\nAs Dean was finishing, old Toot-Toot came by with his red snack-wagon, which was covered with\\nhandlettered Bible quotes (\"REPENT for the LORD shall judge his people,\" Deut. 32:36, \"And surely\\nyour BLOOD of your lives will I require,\" Gen. 9:5, and similar cheery, uplifting sentiments), and sold\\nus some sandwiches and pops. Dean was hunting for change in his pocket and saying that we wouldnt\\nsee Steamboat Willy anymore, that goddam Percy Wetmore had scared him off for good, when old\\nToot-Toot said, Whats thatere, then?\"\\nWe looked, and here came the mouse of the hour his ownself, hopping up the middle of the Green Mile.\\nHed come a little way; then stop, look around with his bright little oildrop eyes, then come on again.\\n\"Hey, mouse!\" The Chief said, and the mouse stopped and looked at him, whiskers twitching. I tell you,\\nit was exactly as if the damned thing knew it had been called. \"You some kind of spirit guide?\"\\n\\n\\x0cBitterbuck tossed the mouse a little morsel of cheese from his supper. It landed right in front of the\\nmouse, but Steamboat Willy hardly even glanced at it, just came on his way again, up the Green Mile,\\nlooking in empty cells.\\n\"Boss Edgecombe!\" The. President called. \"Do you think that little bastard knows Wetmore isnt here? I\\ndo, by God!\"\\nI felt about the same ... but I wasnt going to say so out loud.\\nHarry came out into the hall, hitching up his pants the way he always did after hed spent a refreshing few\\nminutes in the can, and stood there with his eyes wide. Toot-Toot was also staring, a sunken grin doing\\nunpleasant things to the soft and toothless lower half of his face.\\nThe mouse stopped in what was becoming its usual spot, curled its tail around its paws, The terror, which would not end for another twenty-eight years—if it ever did end—began, so far as I\\nknow or can tell, with a boat made from a sheet of newspaper floating down a gutter swollen with\\nrain.\\nThe boat bobbed, listed, righted itself again, dived bravely through treacherous whirlpools, and\\ncontinued on its way down Witcham Street toward the traffic light which marked the intersection of\\nWitcham and Jackson. The three vertical lenses on all sides of the traffic light were dark this\\nafternoon in the fall of 1957, and the houses were all dark, too. There had been steady rain for a week\\nnow, and two days ago the winds had come as well. Most sections of Derry had lost their power then,\\nand it was not back on yet.\\nA small boy in a yellow slicker and red galoshes ran cheerfully along beside the newspaper boat.\\nThe rain had not stopped, but it was finally slackening. It tapped on the yellow hood of the boy’s\\nslicker, sounding to his ears like rain on a shed roof . . . a comfortable, almost cozy sound. The boy in\\nthe yellow slicker was George Denbrough. He was six. His brother, William, known to most of the\\nkids at Derry Elementary School (and even to the teachers, who would never have used the nickname\\nto his face) as Stuttering Bill, was at home, hacking out the last of a nasty case of influenza. In that\\nautumn of 1957, eight months before the real horrors began and twenty-eight years before the final\\nshowdown, Stuttering Bill was ten years old.\\nBill had made the boat beside which George now ran. He had made it sitting up in bed, his back\\npropped against a pile of pillows, while their mother played Für Elise on the piano in the parlor and\\nrain swept restlessly against his bedroom window.\\nAbout three-quarters of the way down the block as one headed toward the intersection and the\\ndead traffic light, Witcham Street was blocked to motor traffic by smudgepots and four orange\\nsawhorses. Stencilled across each of the horses was DERRY DEPT. OF PUBLIC WORKS. Beyond them, the\\nrain had spilled out of gutters clogged with branches and rocks and big sticky piles of autumn leaves.\\nThe water had first pried fingerholds in the paving and then snatched whole greedy handfuls—all of\\nthis by the third day of the rains. By noon of the fourth day, big chunks of the street’s surface were\\nboating through the intersection of Jackson and Witcham like miniature white-water rafts. By that\\ntime, many people in Derry had begun to make nervous jokes about arks. The Public Works\\nDepartment had managed to keep Jackson Street open, but Witcham was impassable from the sawhorses all the way to the center of town.\\nBut everyone agreed, the worst was over. The Kenduskeag Stream had crested just below its banks\\nin the Barrens and bare inches below the concrete sides of the Canal which channelled it tightly as it\\npassed through downtown. Right now a gang of men—Zack Denbrough, George’s and Bill’s father,\\namong them—were removing the sandbags they had thrown up the day before with such panicky\\nhaste. Yesterday overflow and expensive flood damage had seemed almost inevitable. God knew it\\nhad happened before—the flooding in 1931 had been a disaster which had cost millions of dollars\\nand almost two dozen lives. That was a long time ago, but there were still enough people around who\\n\\n\\x0cremembered it to scare the rest. One of the flood victims had been found twenty-five miles east, in\\nBucksport. The fish had eaten this unfortunate gentleman’s eyes, three of his fingers, his penis, and\\nmost of his left foot. Clutched in what remained of his hands had been a Ford steering wheel.\\nNow, though, the river was receding, and when the new Bangor Hydro dam went in upstream, the\\nriver would cease to be a threat. Or so said Zack Denbrough, who worked for Bangor Hydroelectric.\\nAs for the rest—well, future floods could take care of themselves. The thing was to get through this\\none, to get the power back on, and then to forget it. In Derry such forgetting of tragedy and disaster\\nwas almost an art, as Bill Denbrough would come to discover in the course of time.\\nGeorge paused just beyond the sawhorses at the edge of a deep ravine that had been cut through the\\ntar surface of Witcham Street. This ravine ran on an almost exact diagonal. It ended on the far side of\\nthe street, roughly forty feet farther down the hill from where he now stood, on the right. He laughed\\naloud—the sound of solitary, childish glee a bright runner in that gray afternoon—as a vagary of the\\nflowing water took his paper boat into a scale-model rapids which had been formed by the break in\\nthe tar. The urgent water had cut a channel which ran along the diagonal, and so his boat travelled\\nfrom one side of Witcham Street to the other, the current carrying it so fast that George had to sprint to\\nkeep up with it. Water sprayed out from beneath his galoshes in muddy sheets. Their buckles made a\\njolly jingling as George Denbrough ran toward his strange death. And the feeling which filled him at\\nthat moment was clear and simple love for his brother Bill . . . love and a touch of regret that Bill\\ncouldn’t be here to see this and be a part of it. Of course he would try to describe it to Bill when he\\ngot home, but he knew he wouldn’t be able to make Bill see it, the way Bill would have been able to\\nmake him see it if their positions had been reversed. Bill was good at reading and writing, but even at\\nhis age George was wise enough to know that wasn’t the only reason why Bill got all A’s on his\\nreport cards, or why his teachers liked his compositions so well. Telling was only part of it. Bill was\\ngood at seeing.\\nThe boat nearly whistled along the diagonal channel, just a page torn from the Classified section of\\nthe Derry News, but now George imagined it as a PT boat in a war movie, like the ones he sometimes\\nsaw down at the Derry Theater with Bill at Saturday matinees. A war picture with John Wayne\\nfighting the Japs. The prow of the newspaper boat threw sprays of water to either side as it rushed\\nalong, and then it reached the gutter on the left side of Witcham Street. A fresh streamlet rushed over\\nthe break in the tar at this point, creating a fairly large whirlpool, and it seemed to him that the boat\\nmust be swamped and capsize. It leaned alarmingly, and then George cheered as it righted itself,\\nturned, and went racing on down toward the intersection. George sprinted to catch up. Over his head,\\na grim gust of October wind rattled the trees, now almost completely unburdened of their freight of\\ncolored leaves by the storm, which had been this year a reaper of the most ruthless sort.\\n\\n2\\nSitting up in bed, his cheeks still flushed with heat (but his fever, like the Kenduskeag, finally\\nreceding), Bill had finished the boat—but when George reached for it, Bill held it out of reach. “NNow get me the p-p-paraffin.”\\n“What’s that? Where is it?”\\n“It’s on the cellar shuh-shuh-shelf as you go d-downstairs,” Bill said. “In a box that says Guh-Guhhulf . . . Gulf. Bring that to me, and a knife, and a b-bowl. And a puh-pack of muh-muh-matches.”\\n\\n\\x0cGeorge had gone obediently to get these things. He could hear his mother playing the piano, not\\nFür Elise now but something else he didn’t like so well—something that sounded dry and fussy; he\\ncould hear rain flicking steadily against the kitchen windows. These were comfortable sounds, but the\\nthought of the cellar was not a bit comfortable. He did not like the cellar, and he did not like going\\ndown the cellar stairs, because he always imagined there was something down there in the dark. That\\nwas silly, of course, his father said so and his mother said so and, even more important, Bill said so,\\nbut still—\\nHe did not even like opening the door to flick on the light because he always had the idea—this\\nwas so exquisitely stupid he didn’t dare tell anyone—that while he was feeling for the light switch,\\nsome horrible clawed paw would settle lightly over his wrist . . . and then jerk him down into the\\ndarkness that smelled of dirt and wet and dim rotted vegetables.\\nStupid! There were no things with claws, all hairy and full of killing spite. Every now and then\\nsomeone went crazy and killed a lot of people—sometimes Chet Huntley told about such things on the\\nevening news—and of course there were Commies, but there was no weirdo monster living down in\\ntheir cellar. Still, this idea lingered. In those interminable moments while he was groping for the\\nswitch with his right hand (his left arm curled around the doorjamb in a deathgrip), that cellar smell\\nseemed to intensify until it filled the world. Smells of dirt and wet and long-gone vegetables would\\nmerge into one unmistakable ineluctable smell, the smell of the monster, the apotheosis of all\\nmonsters. It was the smell of something for which he had no name: the smell of It, crouched and\\nlurking and ready to spring. A creature which would eat anything but which was especially hungry for\\nboymeat.\\nHe had opened the door that morning and had groped interminably for the switch, holding the jamb\\nin his usual deathgrip, his eyes squinched shut, the tip of his tongue poked from the corner of his\\nmouth like an agonized rootlet searching for water in a place of drought. Funny? Sure! You betcha!\\nLookit you, Georgie! Georgie’s scared of the dark! What a baby!\\nThe sound of the piano came from what his father called the living room and what his mother\\ncalled the parlor. It sounded like music from another world, far away, the way talk and laughter on a\\nsummer-crowded beach must sound to an exhausted swimmer who struggles with the undertow.\\nHis fingers found the switch! Ah!\\nThey snapped it—\\n—and nothing. No light.\\nOh, cripes! The power!\\nGeorge snatched his arm back as if from a basket filled with snakes. He stepped back from the\\nopen cellar door, his heart hurrying in his chest. The power was out, of course—he had forgotten the\\npower was out. Jeezly-crow! What now? Go back and tell Bill he couldn’t get the box of paraffin\\nbecause the power was out and he was afraid that something might get him as he stood on the cellar\\nstairs, something that wasn’t a Commie or a mass murderer but a creature much worse than either?\\nThat it would simply slither part of its rotted self up between the stair risers and grab his ankle? That\\nwould go over big, wouldn’t it? Others might laugh at such a fancy, but Bill wouldn’t laugh. Bill\\nwould be mad. Bill would say, “Grow up, Georgie . . . do you want this boat or not?”\\nAs if this thought were his cue, Bill called from his bedroom: “Did you d-d-die out there, JuhGeorgie?”\\n“No, I’m gettin it, Bill,” George called back at once. He rubbed at his arms, trying to make the\\nguilty gooseflesh disappear and be smooth skin again. “I just stopped to get a drink of water.”\\n“Well, h-hurry up!”\\n\\n\\x0cSo he walked down the four steps to the cellar shelf, his heart a warm, beating hammer in his\\nthroat, the hair on the nape of his neck standing at attention, his eyes hot, his hands cold, sure that at\\nany moment the cellar door would swing shut on its own, closing off the white light falling through the\\nkitchen windows, and then he would hear It, something worse than all the Commies and murderers in\\nthe world, worse than the Japs, worse than Attila the Hun, worse than the somethings in a hundred\\nhorror movies. It, growling deeply—he would hear the growl in those lunatic seconds before it\\npounced on him and unzipped his guts.\\nThe cellar-smell was worse than ever today, because of the flood. Their house was high on\\nWitcham Street, near the crest of the hill, and they had escaped the worst of it, but there was still\\nstanding water down there that had seeped in through the old rock foundations. The smell was low\\nand unpleasant, making you want to take only the shallowest breaths.\\nGeorge sifted through the junk on the shelf as fast as he could—old cans of Kiwi shoepolish and\\nshoepolish rags, a broken kerosene lamp, two mostly empty bottles of Windex, an old flat can of\\nTurtle wax. For some reason this can struck him, and he spent nearly thirty seconds looking at the\\nturtle on the lid with a kind of hypnotic wonder. Then he tossed it back . . . and here it was at last, a\\nsquare box with the word GULF on it.\\nGeorge snatched it and ran up the stairs as fast as he could, suddenly aware that his shirttail was\\nout and suddenly sure that his shirttail would be his undoing: the thing in the cellar would allow him\\nto get almost all the way out, and then it would grab the tail of his shirt and snatch him back and—\\nHe reached the kitchen and swept the door shut behind him. It banged gustily. He leaned back\\nagainst it with his eyes closed, sweat popped out on his arms and forehead, the box of paraffin\\ngripped tightly in one hand.\\nThe piano had come to a stop, and his mom’s voice floated to him: “Georgie, can’t you slam that\\ndoor a little harder next time? Maybe you could break some of the plates in the Welsh dresser, if you\\nreally tried.”\\n“Sorry, Mom,” he called back.\\n“Georgie, you waste,” Bill said from his bedroom. He pitched his voice low so their mother\\nwould not hear.\\nGeorge snickered a little. His fear was already gone; it had slipped away from him as easily as a\\nnightmare slips away from a man who awakes, cold-skinned and gasping, from its grip; who feels his\\nbody and stares at his surroundings to make sure that none of it ever happened and who then begins at\\nonce to forget it. Half is gone by the time his feet hit the floor; three-quarters of it by the time he\\nemerges from the shower and begins to towel off; all of it by the time he finishes his breakfast. All\\ngone . . . until the next time, when, in the grip of the nightmare, all fears will be remembered.\\nThat turtle, George thought, going to the counter drawer where the matches were kept. Where did I\\nsee a turtle like that before?\\nBut no answer came, and he dismissed the question.\\nHe got a pack of matches from the drawer, a knife from the rack (holding the sharp edge studiously\\naway from his body, as his dad had taught him), and a small bowl from the Welsh dresser in the dining\\nroom. Then he went back into Bill’s room.\\n“W-What an a-hole you are, Juh-Georgie,” Bill said, amiably enough, and pushed back some of the\\nsick-stuff on his nighttable: an empty glass, a pitcher of water, Kleenex, books, a bottle of Vicks\\nVapoRub—the smell of which Bill would associate all his life with thick, phlegmy chests and snotty\\nnoses. The old Philco radio was there, too, playing not Chopin or Bach but a Little Richard tune . . .\\nvery softly, however, so softly that Little Richard was robbed of all his raw and elemental power.\\n\\n\\x0cTheir mother, who had studied classical piano at Juilliard, hated rock and roll. She did not merely\\ndislike it; she abominated it.\\n“I’m no a-hole,” George said, sitting on the edge of Bill’s bed and putting the things he had\\ngathered on the nighttable.\\n“Yes you are,” Bill said. “Nothing but a great big brown a-hole, that’s you.”\\nGeorge tried to imagine a kid who was nothing but a great big a-hole on legs and began to giggle.\\n“Your a-hole is bigger than Augusta,” Bill said, beginning to giggle, too.\\n“Your a-hole is bigger than the whole state,” George replied. This broke both boys up for nearly\\ntwo minutes.\\nThere followed a whispered conversation of the sort which means very little to anyone save small\\nboys: accusations of who was the biggest a-hole, who had the biggest a-hole, which a-hole was the\\nbrownest, and so on. Finally Bill said one of the forbidden words—he accused George of being a big\\nbrown shitty a-hole—and they both got laughing hard. Bill’s laughter turned into a coughing fit. As it\\nfinally began to taper off (by then Bill’s face had gone a plummy shade which George regarded with\\nsome alarm), the piano stopped again. They both looked in the direction of the parlor, listening for the\\npiano-bench to scrape back, listening for their mother’s impatient footsteps. Bill buried his mouth in\\nthe crook of his elbow, stifling the last of the coughs, pointing at the pitcher at the same time. George\\npoured him a glass of water, which he drank off.\\nThe piano began once more—Für Elise again. Stuttering Bill never forgot that piece, and even\\nmany years later it never failed to bring gooseflesh to his arms and back; his heart would drop and he\\nwould remember: My mother was playing that the day Georgie died.\\n“You gonna cough anymore, Bill?”\\n“No.”\\nBill pulled a Kleenex from the box, made a rumbling sound in his chest, spat phlegm into the\\ntissue, screwed it up, and tossed it into the wastebasket by his bed, which was filled with similar\\ntwists of tissue. Then he opened the box of paraffin and dropped a waxy cube of the stuff into his\\npalm. George watched him closely, but without speaking or questioning. Bill didn’t like George\\ntalking to him while he did stuff, but George had learned that if he just kept his mouth shut, Bill would\\nusually explain what he was doing.\\nBill used the knife to cut off a small piece of the paraffin cube. He put the piece in the bowl, then\\nstruck a match and put it on top of the paraffin. The two boys watched the small yellow flame as the\\ndying wind drove rain against the window in occasional spatters.\\n“Got to waterproof the boat or it’ll just get wet and sink,” Bill said. When he was with George, his\\nstutter was light—sometimes he didn’t stutter at all. In school, however, it could become so bad that\\ntalking became impossible for him. Communication would cease and Bill’s schoolmates would look\\nsomewhere else while Bill clutched the sides of his desk, his face growing almost as red as his hair,\\nhis eyes squeezed into slits as he tried to winch some word out of his stubborn throat. Sometimes—\\nmost times—the word would come. Other times it simply refused. He had been hit by a car when he\\nwas three and knocked into the side of a building; he had remained unconscious for seven hours. Mom\\nsaid it was that accident which had caused the stutter. George sometimes got the feeling that his dad—\\nand Bill himself—was not so sure.\\nThe piece of paraffin in the bowl was almost entirely melted. The match-flame guttered lower,\\ngrowing blue as it hugged the cardboard stick, and then it went out. Bill dipped his finger into the\\nliquid, jerked it out with a faint hiss. He smiled apologetically at George. “Hot,” he said. After a few\\n\\n\\x0cseconds he dipped his finger in again and began to smear the wax along the sides of the boat, where it\\nquickly dried to a milky haze.\\n“Can I do some?” George asked.\\n“Okay. Just don’t get any on the blankets or Mom’ll kill you.”\\nGeorge dipped his finger into the paraffin, which was now very warm but no longer hot, and began\\nto spread it along the other side of the boat.\\n“Don’t put on so much, you a-hole!” Bill said. “You want to sink it on its m-maiden cruise?”\\n“I’m sorry.”\\n“That’s all right. Just g-go easy.”\\nGeorge finished the other side, then held the boat in his hands. It felt a little heavier, but not much.\\n“Too cool,” he said. “I’m gonna go out and sail it.”\\n“Yeah, you do that,” Bill said. He suddenly looked tired—tired and still not very well.\\n“I wish you could come,” George said. He really did. Bill sometimes got bossy after awhile, but\\nhe always had the coolest ideas and he hardly ever hit. “It’s your boat, really.”\\n“She,” Bill said. “You call boats sh-she.”\\n“She, then.”\\n“I wish I could come, too,” Bill said glumly.\\n“Well . . .” George shifted from one foot to the other, the boat in his hands.\\n“You put on your rain-stuff,” Bill said, “or you’ll wind up with the fluh-hu like me. Probably catch\\nit anyway, from my juh-germs.”\\n“Thanks, Bill. It’s a neat boat.” And he did something he hadn’t done for a long time, something\\nBill never forgot: he leaned over and kissed his brother’s cheek.\\n“You’ll catch it for sure now, you a-hole,” Bill said, but he seemed cheered up all the same. He\\nsmiled at George. “Put all this stuff back, too. Or Mom’ll have a b-bird.”\\n“Sure.” He gathered up the waterproofing equipment and crossed the room, the boat perched\\nprecariously on top of the paraffin box, which was sitting askew in the little bowl.\\n“Juh-Juh-Georgie?”\\nGeorge turned back to look at his brother.\\n“Be c-careful.”\\n“Sure.” His brow creased a little. That was something your Mom said, not your big brother. It was\\nas strange as him giving Bill a kiss. “Sure I will.”\\nHe went out. Bill never saw him again.\\n\\n3\\nNow here he was, chasing his boat down the left side of Witcham Street. He was running fast but the\\nwater was running faster and his boat was pulling ahead. He heard a deepening roar and saw that fifty\\nyards farther down the hill the water in the gutter was cascading into a stormdrain that was still open.\\nIt was a long dark semicircle cut into the curbing, and as George watched, a stripped branch, its bark\\nas dark and glistening as sealskin, shot into the stormdrain’s maw. It hung up there for a moment and\\nthen slipped down inside. That was where his boat was headed.\\n“Oh shit and Shinola!” he yelled, dismayed.\\nHe put on speed, and for a moment he thought he would catch the boat. Then one of his feet slipped\\nand he went sprawling, skinning one knee and crying out in pain. From his new pavement-level\\n\\n\\x0cperspective he watched his boat swing around twice, momentarily caught in another whirlpool, and\\nthen disappear.\\n“Shit and Shinola!” he yelled again, and slammed his fist down on the pavement. That hurt too,\\nand he began to cry a little. What a stupid way to lose the boat!\\nHe got up and walked over to the stormdrain. He dropped to his knees and peered in. The water\\nmade a dank hollow sound as it fell into the darkness. It was a spooky sound. It reminded him of—\\n“Huh!” The sound was jerked out of him as if on a string, and he recoiled.\\nThere were yellow eyes in there: the sort of eyes he had always imagined but never actually seen\\ndown in the basement. It’s an animal, he thought incoherently, that’s all it is, some animal, maybe a\\nhousecat that got stuck down in there—\\nStill, he was ready to run—would run in a second or two, when his mental switchboard had dealt\\nwith the shock those two shiny yellow eyes had given him. He felt the rough surface of the macadam\\nunder his fingers, and the thin sheet of cold water flowing around them. He saw himself getting up and\\nbacking away, and that was when a voice—a perfectly reasonable and rather pleasant voice—spoke\\nto him from inside the stormdrain.\\n“Hi, Georgie,” it said.\\nGeorge blinked and looked again. He could barely credit what he saw; it was like something from\\na made-up story, or a movie where you know the animals will talk and dance. If he had been ten years\\nolder, he would not have believed what he was seeing, but he was not sixteen. He was six.\\nThere was a clown in the stormdrain. The light in there was far from good, but it was good enough\\nso that George Denbrough was sure of what he was seeing. It was a clown, like in the circus or on\\nTV. In fact he looked like a cross between Bozo and Clarabell, who talked by honking his (or was it\\nher?—George was never really sure of the gender) horn on Howdy Doody Saturday mornings—\\nBuffalo Bob was just about the only one who could understand Clarabell, and that always cracked\\nGeorge up. The face of the clown in the stormdrain was white, there were funny tufts of red hair on\\neither side of his bald head, and there was a big clown-smile painted over his mouth. If George had\\nbeen inhabiting a later year, he would have surely thought of Ronald McDonald before Bozo or\\nClarabell.\\nThe clown held a bunch of balloons, all colors, like gorgeous ripe fruit in one hand.\\nIn the other he held George’s newspaper boat.\\n“Want your boat, Georgie?” The clown smiled.\\nGeorge smiled back. He couldn’t help it; it was the kind of smile you just had to answer. “I sure\\ndo,” he said.\\nThe clown laughed. “ ‘I sure do.’ That’s good! That’s very good! And how about a balloon?”\\n“Well . . . sure!” He reached forward . . . and then drew his hand reluctantly back. “I’m not\\nsupposed to take stuff from strangers. My dad said so.”\\n“Very wise of your dad,” the clown in the stormdrain said, smiling. How, George wondered, could\\nI have thought his eyes were yellow? They were a bright, dancing blue, the color of his mom’s eyes,\\nand Bill’s. “Very wise indeed. Therefore I will introduce myself. I, Georgie, am Mr. Bob Gray, also\\nknown as Pennywise the Dancing Clown. Pennywise, meet George Denbrough. George, meet\\nPennywise. And now we know each other. I’m not a stranger to you, and you’re not a stranger to me.\\nKee-rect?”\\nGeorge giggled. “I guess so.” He reached forward again . . . and drew his hand back again. “How\\ndid you get down there?”\\n\\n\\x0c“Storm just bleeeew me away,” Pennywise the Dancing Clown said. “It blew the whole circus\\naway. Can you smell the circus, Georgie?”\\nGeorge leaned forward. Suddenly he could smell peanuts! Hot roasted peanuts! And vinegar! The\\nwhite kind you put on your french fries through a hole in the cap! He could smell cotton candy and\\nfrying doughboys and the faint but thunderous odor of wild-animal shit. He could smell the cheery\\naroma of midway sawdust. And yet . . .\\nAnd yet under it all was the smell of flood and decomposing leaves and dark stormdrain shadows.\\nThat smell was wet and rotten. The cellar-smell.\\nBut the other smells were stronger.\\n“You bet I can smell it,” he said.\\n“Want your boat, Georgie?” Pennywise asked. “I only repeat myself because you really do not\\nseem that eager.” He held it up, smiling. He was wearing a baggy silk suit with great big orange\\nbuttons. A bright tie, electric-blue, flopped down his front, and on his hands were big white gloves,\\nlike the kind Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck always wore.\\n“Yes, sure,” George said, looking into the stormdrain.\\n“And a balloon? I’ve got red and green and yellow and blue. . . .”\\n“Do they float?”\\n“Float?” The clown’s grin widened. “Oh yes, indeed they do. They float! And there’s cotton\\ncandy. . . .”\\nGeorge reached.\\nThe clown seized his arm.\\nAnd George saw the clown’s face change.\\nWhat he saw then was terrible enough to make his worst imaginings of the thing in the cellar look\\nlike sweet dreams; what he saw destroyed his sanity in one clawing stroke.\\n“They float,” the thing in the drain crooned in a clotted, chuckling voice. It held George’s arm in\\nits thick and wormy grip, it pulled George toward that terrible darkness where the water rushed and\\nroared and bellowed as it bore its cargo of storm debris toward the sea. George craned his neck\\naway from that final blackness and began to scream into the rain, to scream mindlessly into the white\\nautumn sky which curved above Derry on that day in the fall of 1957. His screams were shrill and\\npiercing, and all up and down Witcham Street people came to their windows or bolted out onto their\\nporches.\\n“They float,” it growled, “they float, Georgie, and when you’re down here with me, you’ll float,\\ntoo—”\\nGeorge’s shoulder socked against the cement of the curb and Dave Gardener, who had stayed home\\nfrom his job at The Shoeboat that day because of the flood, saw only a small boy in a yellow\\nrainslicker, a small boy who was screaming and writhing in the gutter with muddy water surfing over\\nhis face and making his screams sound bubbly.\\n“Everything down here floats,” that chuckling, rotten voice whispered, and suddenly there was a\\nripping noise and a flaring sheet of agony, and George Denbrough knew no more.\\nDave Gardener was the first to get there, and although he arrived only forty-five seconds after the\\nfirst scream, George Denbrough was already dead. Gardener grabbed him by the back of the slicker,\\npulled him into the street . . . and began to scream himself as George’s body turned over in his hands.\\nThe left side of George’s slicker was now bright red. Blood flowed into the stormdrain from the\\ntattered hole where the left arm had been. A knob of bone, horribly bright, peeked through the torn\\ncloth.\\n\\n\\x0cThe boy’s eyes stared up into the white sky, and as Dave staggered away toward the others already\\nrunning pell-mell down the street, they began to fill up with rain.\\n\\n4\\nSomewhere below, in the stormdrain that was already filled nearly to capacity with runoff (there\\ncould have been no one down there, the County Sheriff would later exclaim to a Derry News reporter\\nwith a frustrated fury so great it was almost agony; Hercules himself would have been swept away in\\nthat driving current), George’s newspaper boat shot onward through nighted chambers and long\\nconcrete hallways that roared and chimed with water. For awhile it ran neck-and-neck with a dead\\nchicken that floated with its yellowy, reptilian toes pointed at the dripping ceiling; then, at some\\njunction east of town, the chicken was swept off to the left while George’s boat went straight.\\nAn hour later, while George’s mother was being sedated in the Emergency Room at Derry Home\\nHospital and while Stuttering Bill sat stunned and white and silent in his bed, listening to his father\\nsob hoarsely in the parlor where his mother had been playing Für Elise when George went out, the\\nboat shot out through a concrete loophole like a bullet exiting the muzzle of a gun and ran at speed\\ndown a sluiceway and into an unnamed stream. When it joined the boiling, swollen Penobscot River\\ntwenty minutes later, the first rifts of blue had begun to show in the sky overhead. The storm was over.\\nThe boat dipped and swayed and sometimes took on water, but it did not sink; the two brothers had\\nwaterproofed it well. I do not know where it finally fetched up, if ever it did; perhaps it reached the\\nsea and sails there forever, like a magic boat in a fairytale. All I know is that it was still afloat and\\nstill running on the breast of the flood when it passed the incorporated town limits of Derry, Maine,\\nand there it passes out of this tale forever.\\n\\n\\x0cC HAP T ER 2\\n\\nAfter the Festival (1984)\\n1\\nThe reason Adrian was wearing the hat, his sobbing boyfriend would later tell the police, was\\nbecause he had won it at the Pitch Til U Win stall on the Bassey Park fairgrounds just six days before\\nhis death. He was proud of it.\\n“He was wearing it because he loved this shitty little town!” the boyfriend, Don Hagarty, screamed\\nat the cops.\\n“Now, now—there’s no need for that sort of language,” Officer Harold Gardener told Hagarty.\\nHarold Gardener was one of Dave Gardener’s four sons. On the day his father had discovered the\\nlifeless, one-armed body of George Denbrough, Harold Gardener had been five. On this day, almost\\ntwenty-seven years later, he was thirty-two and balding. Harold Gardener recognized the reality of\\nDon Hagarty’s grief and pain, and at the same time found it impossible to take seriously. This man—if\\nyou want to call him a man—was wearing lipstick and satin pants so tight you could almost read the\\nwrinkles in his cock. Grief or no grief, pain or no pain, he was, after all, just a queer. Like his friend,\\nthe late Adrian Mellon.\\n“Let’s go through it again,” Harold’s partner, Jeffrey Reeves, said. “The two of you came out of the\\nFalcon and turned toward the Canal. Then what?”\\n“How many times do I have to tell you idiots?” Hagarty was still screaming. “They killed him!\\nThey pushed him over the side! Just another day in Macho City for them!” Don Hagarty began to cry.\\n“One more time,” Reeves repeated patiently. “You came out of the Falcon. Then what?”\\n\\n2\\nIn an interrogation room just down the hall, two Derry cops were speaking with Steve Dubay,\\nseventeen; in the Clerk of Probate’s office upstairs, two more were questioning John “Webby”\\nGarton, eighteen; and in the Chief of Police’s office on the fifth floor, Chief Andrew Rademacher and\\nAssistant District Attorney Tom Boutillier were questioning fifteen-year-old Christopher Unwin.\\nUnwin, who wore faded jeans, a grease-smeared tee-shirt, and blocky engineer boots, was weeping.\\nRademacher and Boutillier had taken him because they had quite accurately assessed him as the weak\\nlink in the chain.\\n“Let’s go through it again,” Boutillier said in this office just as Jeffrey Reeves was saying the same\\nthing two floors down.\\n“We didn’t mean to kill him,” Unwin blubbered. “It was the hat. We couldn’t believe he was still\\nwearing the hat after, you know, after what Webby said the first time. And I guess we wanted to scare\\nhim.”\\n“For what he said,” Chief Rademacher interjected.\\n“Yes.”\\n“To John Garton, on the afternoon of the 17th.”\\n\\n\\x0c“Yes, to Webby.” Unwin burst into fresh tears. “But we tried to save him when we saw he was in\\ntrouble . . . at least me and Stevie Dubay did . . . we didn’t mean to kill him!”\\n“Come on, Chris, don’t shit us,” Boutillier said. “You threw the little queer into the Canal.”\\n“Yes, but—”\\n“And the three of you came in to make a clean breast of things. Chief Rademacher and I appreciate\\nthat, don’t we, Andy?”\\n“You bet. It takes a man to own up to what he did, Chris.”\\n“So don’t fuck yourself up by lying now. You meant to throw him over the minute you saw him and\\nhis fag buddy coming out of the Falcon, didn’t you?”\\n“No!” Chris Unwin protested vehemently.\\nBoutillier took a pack of Marlboros from his shirt pocket and stuck one in his mouth. He offered\\nthe pack to Unwin. “Cigarette?”\\nUnwin took one. Boutillier had to chase the tip with a match in order to give him a light because of\\nthe way Unwin’s mouth was trembling.\\n“But when you saw he was wearing the hat?” Rademacher asked.\\nUnwin dragged deep, lowered his head so that his greasy hair fell in his eyes, and jetted smoke\\nfrom his nose, which was littered with blackheads.\\n“Yeah,” he said, almost too softly to be heard.\\nBoutillier leaned forward, brown eyes gleaming. His face was predatory but his voice was gentle.\\n“What, Chris?”\\n“I said yes. I guess so. To throw him in. But not to kill him.” He looked up at them, face frantic and\\nmiserable and still unable to comprehend the stupendous changes which had taken place in his life\\nsince he left the house to take in the last night of Derry’s Canal Days Festival with two of his buddies\\nat seven-thirty the previous evening. “Not to kill him!” he repeated. “And that guy under the\\nbridge . . . I still don’t know who he was.”\\n“What guy was that?” Rademacher asked, but without much interest. They had heard this part\\nbefore as well, and neither of them believed it—sooner or later men accused of murder almost\\nalways drag out that mysterious other guy. Boutillier even had a name for it: he called it the “OneArmed Man Syndrome,” after that old TV series The Fugitive.\\n“The guy in the clown suit,” Chris Unwin said, and shivered. “The guy with the balloons.”\\n\\n3\\nThe Canal Days Festival, which ran from July 15th to July 21st, had been a rousing success, most\\nDerry residents agreed: a great thing for the city’s morale, image . . . and pocketbook. The week-long\\nfestival was pegged to mark the centenary of the opening of the Canal which ran through the middle of\\ndowntown. It had been the Canal which had fully opened Derry to the lumber trade in the years 1884\\nto 1910; it had been the Canal which had birthed Derry’s boom years.\\nThe town was spruced up from east to west and north to south. Potholes which some residents\\nswore hadn’t been patched for ten years or more were neatly filled with hottop and rolled smooth.\\nThe town buildings were refurbished on the inside, repainted on the outside. The worst of the graffiti\\nin Bassey Park—much of it coolly logical anti-gay statements such as KILL ALL QUEERS and AIDS FROM\\nGOD YOU HELLBOUND HOMOS!!—was sanded off the benches and wooden walls of the little covered\\nwalkway over the Canal known as the Kissing Bridge.\\n\\n\\x0cA Canal Days Museum was installed in three empty storefronts downtown, and filled with exhibits\\nby Michael Hanlon, a local librarian and amateur historian. The town’s oldest families loaned freely\\nof their almost priceless treasures, and during the week of the festival nearly forty thousand visitors\\npaid a quarter each to look at eating-house menus from the 1890s, loggers’ bitts, axes, and peaveys\\nfrom the 1880s, children’s toys from the 1920s, and over two thousand photographs and nine reels of\\nmovie film of life as it had been in Derry over the last hundred years.\\nThe museum was sponsored by the Derry Ladies’ Society, which vetoed some of Hanlon’s\\nproposed exhibits (such as the notorious tramp-chair from the 1930s) and photographs (such as those\\nof the Bradley Gang after the notorious shoot-out). But all agreed it was a great success, and no one\\nreally wanted to see those gory old things anyway. It was so much better to accentuate the positive\\nand eliminate the negative, as the old song said.\\nThere was a huge striped refreshment tent in Derry Park, and band concerts there every night. In\\nBassey Park there was a carnival with rides by Smokey’s Greater Shows and games run by local\\ntownfolk. A special tram-car circled the historic sections of the town every hour on the hour and\\nended up at this gaudy and amiable money-machine.\\nIt was here that Adrian Mellon won the hat which would get him killed, the paper top-hat with the\\nflower and the band which said I DERRY!\\n\\n4\\n“I’m tired,” John “Webby” Garton said. Like his two friends, he was dressed in unconscious imitation\\nof Bruce Springsteen, although if asked he would probably call Springsteen a wimp or a fagola and\\nwould instead profess admiration for such “bitchin” heavy-metal groups as Def Leppard, Twisted\\nSister, or Judas Priest. The sleeves of his plain blue tee-shirt were torn off, showing his heavily\\nmuscled arms. His thick brown hair fell over one eye—this touch was more John Cougar Mellencamp\\nthan Springsteen. There were blue tattoos on his arms—arcane symbols which looked as if they had\\nbeen drawn by a child. “I don’t want to talk no more.”\\n“Just tell us about Tuesday afternoon at the fair,” Paul Hughes said. Hughes was tired and shocked\\nand dismayed by this whole sordid business. He thought again and again that it was as if Derry Canal\\nDays ended with one final event which everyone had somehow known about but which no one had\\nquite dared to put down on the Daily Program of Events. If they had, it would have looked like this:\\nSaturday, 9:00 P.M.: Final band concert featuring the Derry High School Band and the Barber Shop\\nMello-Men.\\nSaturday, 10:00 P.M.: Giant fireworks show.\\nSaturday, 10:35 P.M.: Ritual sacrifice of Adrian Mellon officially ends Canal Days.\\n“Fuck the fair,” Webby replied.\\n“Just what you said to Mellon and what he said to you.”\\n“Oh Christ.” Webby rolled his eyes.\\n“Come on, Webby,” Hughes’s partner said.\\nWebby Garton rolled his eyes and began again.\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0cGarton saw the two of them, Mellon and Hagarty, mincing along with their arms about each other’s\\nwaists and giggling like a couple of girls. At first he actually thought they were a couple of girls. Then\\nhe recognized Mellon, who had been pointed out to him before. As he looked, he saw Mellon turn to\\nHagarty . . . and they kissed briefly.\\n“Oh, man, I’m gonna barf!” Webby cried, disgusted.\\nChris Unwin and Steve Dubay were with him. When Webby pointed out Mellon, Steve Dubay said\\nhe thought the other fag was named Don somebody, and that he’d picked up a kid from Derry High\\nhitching and then tried to put a few moves on him.\\nMellon and Hagarty began to move toward the three boys again, walking away from the Pitch Til U\\nWin and toward the carny’s exit. Webby Garton would later tell Officers Hughes and Conley that his\\n“civic pride” had been wounded by seeing a fucking faggot wearing a hat which said I DERRY. It\\nwas a silly thing, that hat—a paper imitation of a top hat with a great big flower sticking up from the\\ntop and nodding about in every direction. The silliness of the hat apparently wounded Webby’s civic\\npride even more.\\nAs Mellon and Hagarty passed, each with his arm linked about the other’s waist, Webby Garton\\nyelled out: “I ought to make you eat that hat, you fucking ass-bandit!”\\nMellon turned toward Garton, fluttered his eyes flirtatiously, and said: “If you want something to\\neat, hon, I can find something much tastier than my hat.”\\nAt this point Webby Garton decided he was going to rearrange the faggot’s face. In the geography\\nof Mellon’s face, mountains would rise and continents would drift. Nobody suggested he sucked the\\nroot. Nobody.\\nHe started toward Mellon. Mellon’s friend Hagarty, alarmed, attempted to pull Mellon away, but\\nMellon stood his ground, smiling. Garton would later tell Officers Hughes and Conley that he was\\npretty sure Mellon was high on something. So he was, Hagarty would agree when this idea was\\npassed on to him by Officers Gardener and Reeves. He was high on two fried doughboys smeared\\nwith honey, on the carnival, on the whole day. He had been consequently unable to recognize the real\\nmenace which Webby Garton represented.\\n“But that was Adrian,” Don said, using a tissue to wipe his eyes and smearing the spangled\\neyeshadow he was wearing. “He didn’t have much in the way of protective coloration. He was one of\\nthose fools who think things really are going to turn out all right.”\\nHe might have been badly hurt there and then if Garton hadn’t felt something tap his elbow. It was\\na nightstick. He turned his head to see Officer Frank Machen, another member of Derry’s Finest.\\n“Never mind, little buddy,” Machen told Garton. “Mind your business and leave those little gay\\nboyos alone. Have some fun.”\\n“Did you hear what he called me?” Garton asked hotly. He was now joined by Unwin and Dubay\\n—the two of them, smelling trouble, tried to urge Garton on up the midway, but Garton shrugged them\\naway, would have turned on them with his fists if they had persisted. His masculinity had borne an\\ninsult which he felt must be avenged. Nobody suggested he sucked the root. Nobody.\\n“I don’t believe he called you anything,” Machen replied. “And you spoke to him first, I believe.\\nNow move on, sonny. I don’t want to have to tell you again.”\\n“He called me a queer!”\\n“Are you worried you might be, then?” Machen asked, seeming to be honestly interested, and\\nGarton flushed a deep ugly red.\\nDuring this exchange, Hagarty was trying with increasing desperation to pull Adrian Mellon away\\nfrom the scene. Now, at last, Mellon was going.\\n\\n\\x0c“Ta-ta, love!” Adrian called cheekily over his shoulder.\\n“Shut up, candy-ass,” Machen said. “Get out of here.”\\nGarton made a lunge at Mellon, and Machen grabbed him.\\n“I can run you in, my friend,” Machen said, “and the way you’re acting, it might not be such a bad\\nidea.”\\n“Next time I see you I’m gonna hurt you!” Garton bellowed after the departing pair, and heads\\nturned to stare at him. “And if you’re wearing that hat, I’m gonna kill you! This town don’t need no\\nfaggots like you!”\\nWithout turning, Mellon waggled the fingers of his left hand—the nails were painted cerise—and\\nput an extra little wiggle in his walk. Garton lunged again.\\n“One more word or one more move and in you go,” Machen said mildly. “Trust me, my boy, for I\\nmean exactly what I say.”\\n“Come on, Webby,” Chris Unwin said uneasily. “Mellow out.”\\n“You like guys like that?” Webby asked Machen, ignoring Chris and Steve completely. “Huh?”\\n“About the bum-punchers I’m neutral,” Machen said. “What I’m really in favor of is peace and\\nquiet, and you are upsetting what I like, pizza face. Now do you want to go a round with me or what?”\\n“Come on, Webby,” Steve Dubay said quietly. “Let’s go get some hot dogs.”\\nWebby went, straightening his shirt with exaggerated moves and brushing the hair out of his eyes.\\nMachen, who also gave a statement on the morning following Adrian Mellon’s death, said: The last\\nthing I heard him say as him and his buddies walked off was, “Next time I see him he’s going to be\\nin serious hurt.”\\n\\n6\\n“Please, I got to talk to my mother,” Steve Dubay said for the third time. “I’ve got to get her to mellow\\nout my stepfather, or there is going to be one hell of a punching-match when I get home.”\\n“In a little while,” Officer Charles Avarino told him. Both Avarino and his partner, Barney\\nMorrison, knew that Steve Dubay would not be going home tonight and maybe not for many nights to\\ncome. The boy did not seem to realize just how heavy this particular bust was, and Avarino would not\\nbe surprised when he learned, later on, that Dubay had left school at age sixteen. At that time he had\\nstill been in Water Street Junior High. His IQ was 68, according to the Wechsler he had taken during\\none of his three trips through the seventh grade.\\n“Tell us what happened when you saw Mellon coming out of the Falcon,” Morrison invited.\\n“No, man, I better not.”\\n“Well, why not?” Avarino asked.\\n“I already talked too much, maybe.”\\n“You came in to talk,” Avarino said. “Isn’t that right?”\\n“Well . . . yeah . . . but . . .”\\n“Listen,” Morrison said warmly, sitting down next to Dubay and shooting him a cigarette. “You\\nthink me and Chick here like fags?”\\n“I don’t know—”\\n“Do we look like we like fags?”\\n“No, but . . .”\\n\\n\\x0c“We’re your friends, Steve-o,” Morrison said solemnly. “And believe me, you and Chris and\\nWebby need all the friends you can get just about now. Because tomorrow every bleeding heart in this\\ntown is going to be screaming for you guys’s blood.”\\nSteve Dubay looked dimly alarmed. Avarino, who could almost read this hairbag’s pussy little\\nmind, suspected he was thinking about his stepfather again. And although Avarino had no liking for\\nDerry’s small gay community—like every other cop on the force, he would enjoy seeing the Falcon\\nshut up forever—he would have been delighted to drive Dubay home himself. He would, in fact, have\\nbeen delighted to hold Dubay’s arms while Dubay’s stepfather beat the creep to oatmeal. Avarino did\\nnot like gays, but this did not mean he believed they should be tortured and murdered. Mellon had\\nbeen savaged. When they brought him up from under the Canal bridge, his eyes had been open,\\nbulging with terror. And this guy here had absolutely no idea of what he had helped do.\\n“We didn’t mean to hurt im,” Steve repeated. This was his fallback position when he became even\\nslightly confused.\\n“That’s why you want to get out front with us,” Avarino said earnestly. “Get the true facts of the\\nmatter out in front, and this maybe won’t amount to a pisshole in the snow. Isn’t that right, Barney?”\\n“As rain,” Morrison agreed.\\n“One more time, what do you say?” Avarino coaxed.\\n“Well . . .” Steve said, and then, slowly, began to talk.\\n\\n7\\nWhen the Falcon was opened in 1973, Elmer Curtie thought his clientele would consist mostly of busriders—the terminal next door serviced three different lines: Trailways, Greyhound, and Aroostook\\nCounty. What he failed to realize was how many of the passengers who ride buses are women or\\nfamilies with small children in tow. Many of the others kept their bottles in brown bags and never got\\noff the bus at all. Those who did were usually soldiers or sailors who wanted no more than a quick\\nbeer or two—you couldn’t very well go on a bender during a ten-minute rest-stop.\\nCurtie had begun to realize some of these home truths by 1977, but by then it was too late: he was\\nup to his tits in bills and there was no way that he could see out of the red ink. The idea of burning the\\nplace down for the insurance occurred to him, but unless he hired a professional to torch it, he\\nsupposed he would be caught . . . and he had no idea where professional arsonists hung out, anyway.\\nHe decided in February of that year that he would give it until July 4th; if things didn’t look as if\\nthey were turning around by then, he would simply walk next door, get on ’hound, and see how things\\nlooked down in Florida.\\nBut in the next five months, an amazing quiet sort of prosperity came to the bar, which was painted\\nblack and gold inside and decorated with stuffed birds (Elmer Curtie’s brother had been an amateur\\ntaxidermist who specialized in birds, and Elmer had inherited the stuff when he died). Suddenly,\\ninstead of drawing sixty beers and pouring maybe twenty drinks a night, Elmer was drawing eighty\\nbeers and pouring a hundred drinks . . . a hundred and twenty . . . sometimes a hundred and sixty.\\nHis clientele was young, polite, almost exclusively male. Many of them dressed outrageously, but\\nthose were years when outrageous dress was still almost the norm, and Elmer Curtie did not realize\\nthat his patrons were just about almost exclusively gay until 1981 or so. If Derry residents had heard\\nhim say this, they would have laughed and said that Elmer Curtie must think they had all been born\\nyesterday—but his claim was perfectly true. Like the man with the cheating wife, he was practically\\n\\n\\x0cthe last to know . . . and by the time he did, he didn’t care. The bar was making money, and while\\nthere were four other bars in Derry which turned a profit, the Falcon was the only one where\\nrambunctious patrons did not regularly demolish the whole place. There were no women to fight over,\\nfor one thing, and these men, fags or not, seemed to have learned a secret of getting along with each\\nother which their heterosexual counterparts did not know.\\nOnce he became aware of the sexual preference of his regulars, he seemed to hear lurid stories\\nabout the Falcon everywhere—these stories had been circulating for years, but until ’81 Curtie simply\\nhadn’t heard them. The most enthusiastic tellers of these tales, he came to realize, were men who\\nwouldn’t be dragged into the Falcon with a chainfall for fear all the muscles would go out of their\\nwrists, or something. Yet they seemed privy to all sorts of information.\\nAccording to the stories, you could go in there any night and see men close-dancing, rubbing their\\ncocks together right out on the dancefloor; men french-kissing at the bar; men getting blowjobs in the\\nbathrooms. There was supposedly a room out back where you went if you wanted to spend a little\\ntime on the Tower of Power—there was a big old fellow in a Nazi uniform back there who kept his\\narm greased most of the way to the shoulder and who would be happy to take care of you.\\nIn fact, none of these things were true. When folks with a thirst did come in from the bus station for\\na beer or a highball, they sensed nothing out of the ordinary in the Falcon at all—there were a lot of\\nguys, sure, but that was no different than thousands of workingmen’s bars all across the country. The\\nclientele was gay, but gay was not a synonym for stupid. If they wanted a little outrageousness, they\\nwent to Portland. If they wanted a lot of outrageousness—Ramrod-style outrageousness or Peck’s Big\\nBoy-style outrageousness—they went down to New York or Boston. Derry was small, Derry was\\nprovincial, and Derry’s small gay community understood the shadow under which it existed quite\\nwell.\\nDon Hagarty had been coming into the Falcon for two or three years on the night in March of 1984\\nwhen he first showed up with Adrian Mellon. Before then, Hagarty had been the sort who plays the\\nfield, rarely showing up with the same escort half a dozen times. But by late April it had become\\nobvious even to Elmer Curtie, who cared very little about such things, that Hagarty and Mellon had a\\nsteady thing going.\\nHagarty was a draftsman with an engineering firm in Bangor. Adrian Mellon was a freelance\\nwriter who published anywhere and everywhere he could—airline magazines, confession magazines,\\nregional magazines, Sunday supplements, sex-letter magazines. He had been working on a novel, but\\nmaybe that wasn’t serious—he had been working on it since his third year of college, and that had\\nbeen twelve years ago.\\nHe had come to Derry to write a piece about the Canal—he was on assignment from New England\\nByways, a glossy bi-monthly that was published in Concord. Adrian Mellon had taken the assignment\\nbecause he could squeeze Byways for three weeks’ worth of expense money, including a nice room at\\nthe Derry Town House, and gather all the material he needed for the piece in maybe five days. During\\nthe other two weeks he could gather enough material for maybe four other regional pieces.\\nBut during that three-week period he met Don Hagarty, and instead of going back to Portland when\\nhis three weeks on the cuff were over, he found himself a small apartment on Kossuth Lane. He lived\\nthere for only six weeks. Then he moved in with Don Hagarty.\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\x0cThat summer, Hagarty told Harold Gardener and Jeff Reeves, was the happiest summer of his life—\\nhe should have been on the lookout, he said; he should have known that God only puts a rug under\\nguys like him in order to jerk it out from under their feet.\\nThe only shadow, he said, was Adrian’s extravagantly partisan reaction to Derry. He had a teeshirt which said MAINE AIN’T BAD BUT DERRY’S GREAT! He had a Derry Tigers high-school jacket. And\\nof course there was the hat. He claimed to find the atmosphere vital and creatively invigorating.\\nPerhaps there was something to this: he had taken his languishing novel out of the trunk for the first\\ntime in nearly a year.\\n“Was he really working on it, then?” Gardener asked Hagarty, not really caring but wanting to keep\\nHagarty primed.\\n“Yes—he was busting pages. He said it might be a terrible novel, but it was no longer going to be\\na terrible unfinished novel. He expected to finish it by his birthday, in October. Of course, he didn’t\\nknow what Derry was really like. He thought he did, but he hadn’t been here long enough to get a\\nwhiff of the real Derry. I kept trying to tell him, but he wouldn’t listen.”\\n“And what’s Derry really like, Don?” Reeves asked.\\n“It’s a lot like a dead strumpet with maggots squirming out of her cooze,” Don Hagarty said.\\nThe two cops stared in silent amazement.\\n“It’s a bad place,” Hagarty said. “It’s a sewer. You mean you two guys don’t know that? You two\\nguys have lived here all of your lives and you don’t know that?”\\nNeither of them answered. After a little while, Hagarty went on.\\n\\n9\\nUntil Adrian Mellon entered his life, Don had been planning to leave Derry. He had been there for\\nthree years, mostly because he had agreed to a long-term lease on an apartment with the world’s most\\nfantastic river-view, but now the lease was almost up and Don was glad. No more long commute back\\nand forth to Bangor. No more weird vibes—in Derry, he once told Adrian, it always felt like thirteen\\no’clock. Adrian might think Derry was a great place, but it scared Don. It was not just the town’s\\ntightly homophobic attitude, an attitude as clearly expressed by the town’s preachers as by the graffiti\\nin Bassey Park, but that was one thing he had been able to put his finger on. Adrian had laughed.\\n“Don, every town in America has a contingent that hates the gayfolk,” he said. “Don’t tell me you\\ndon’t know that. This is, after all, the era of Ronnie Moron and Phyllis Housefly.”\\n“Come down to Bassey Park with me,” Don had replied, after seeing that Adrian really meant\\nwhat he was saying—and what he was really saying was that Derry was no worse than any other fairsized town in the hinterlands. “I want to show you something, my love.”\\nThey drove to Bassey Park—this had been in mid-June, about a month before Adrian’s murder,\\nHagarty told the cops. He took Adrian into the dark, vaguely unpleasant-smelling shadows of the\\nKissing Bridge. He pointed out one of the graffiti. Adrian had to strike a match and hold it below the\\nwriting in order to read it.\\nSHOW ME YOUR COCK QUEER AND I’LL CUT IT OFF YOU.\\n“I know how people feel about gays,” Don said quietly. “I got beaten up at a truck-stop in Dayton\\nwhen I was a teenager; some fellows in Portland set my shoes on fire outside of a sandwich shop\\nwhile this fat-assed old cop sat inside his cruiser and laughed. I’ve seen a lot . . . but I’ve never seen\\nanything quite like this. Look over here. Check it out.”\\n\\n\\x0cAnother match revealed STICK NAILS IN EYES OF ALL FAGOTS (FOR GOD)!\\n“Whoever writes these little homilies has got a case of the deep-down crazies. I’d feel better if I\\nthought it was just one person, one isolated sickie, but . . .” Don swept his arm vaguely down the\\nlength of the Kissing Bridge. “There’s a lot of this stuff . . . and I just don’t think one person did it all.\\nThat’s why I want to leave Derry, Ade. Too many places and too many people seem to have the deepdown crazies.”\\n“Well, wait until I finish my novel, okay? Please? October, I promise, no later. The air’s better\\nhere.”\\n“He didn’t know it was the water he was going to have to watch out for,” Don Hagarty said\\nbitterly.\\n\\n10\\nTom Boutillier and Chief Rademacher leaned forward, neither of them speaking. Chris Unwin sat\\nwith his head down, talking monotonously to the floor. This was the part they wanted to hear; this was\\nthe part that was going to send at least two of these assholes to Thomaston.\\n“The fair wasn’t no good,” Unwin said. “They was already takin down all the bitchin rides, you\\nknow, like the Devil Dish and the Parachute Drop. They already had a sign on the Bumper Cars that\\nsaid ‘closed.’ Wasn’t nothing open but baby rides. So we went down by the games and Webby saw the\\nPitch Til U Win and he paid fifty cents and he seen that hat the queer was wearing and he pitched at\\nthat, but he kept missing it, and every time he missed he got more in a bad mood, you know? And\\nSteve—he’s the guy who usually goes around saying mellow out, like mellow out this and mellow out\\nthat and why don’t you fuckin mellow out, you know? Only he was in a real piss-up-a-rope mood\\nbecause he took this pill, you know? I don’t know what kind of a pill. A red pill. Maybe it was even\\nlegal. But he keeps after Webby until I thought Webby was gonna hit him, you know. He goes, You\\ncan’t even win that queer’s hat. You must be really wasted if you can’t even win that queer’s hat. So\\nfinally the lady gives im a prize even though the ring wasn’t over it, cause I think she wanted to get rid\\nof us. I don’t know. Maybe she didn’t. But I think she did. It was this noisemaker thing, you know?\\nYou blow it and it puffs up and unrolls and makes a noise like a fart, you know? I used to have one of\\nthose. I got it for Halloween or New Year’s or some fuckin holiday, I thought it was pretty good, only\\nI lost it. Or maybe somebody hawked it out of my pocket in the fuckin playyard at school, you know?\\nSo then the fair’s closin and we’re walkin out and Steve’s still on Webby about not bein able to win\\nthat queer’s hat, you know, and Webby ain’t sayin much, and I know that’s a bad sign but I was pretty\\n’faced, you know? So I knew I ought to like change the subject only I couldn’t think of no subject, you\\nknow? So when we get into the parkin lot Steve says, Where you want to go? Home? And Webby\\ngoes, Let’s cruise by the Falcon first and see if that queer’s around.”\\nBoutillier and Rademacher exchanged a glance. Boutillier raised a single finger and tapped it\\nagainst his cheek: although this doofus in the engineer boots didn’t know it, he was now talking about\\nfirst-degree murder.\\n“So I goes no, I gotta get home, and Webby goes, You scared to go by that queer-bar? And I go,\\nFuck no! And Steve’s still high or something, and he says, Let’s go grease some queermeat! Let’s go\\ngrease some queermeat! Let’s go grease . . .”\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0cThe timing was just right enough so that things worked out wrong for everyone. Adrian Mellon and\\nDon Hagarty came out of the Falcon after two beers, walked up past the bus station, and then linked\\nhands. Neither of them thought about it; it was just something they did. It was ten-twenty. They\\nreached the corner and turned left.\\nThe Kissing Bridge was almost half a mile upriver from here; they meant to cross Main Street\\nBridge, which was much less picturesque. The Kenduskeag was summer-low, no more than four feet\\nof water sliding listlessly around the concrete pilings.\\nWhen the Duster drew abreast of them (Steve Dubay had spotted the two of them coming out of the\\nFalcon and gleefully pointed them out), they were on the edge of the span.\\n“Cut in! Cut in!” Webby Garton screamed. The two men had just passed under a streetlight and he\\nhad spotted the fact that they were holding hands. This infuriated him . . . but not as much as the hat\\ninfuriated him. The big paper flower was nodding crazily this way and that. “Cut in, goddammit!”\\nAnd Steve did.\\nChris Unwin would deny active participation in what followed, but Don Hagarty told a different\\nstory. He said that Garton was out of the car almost before it stopped, and that the other two quickly\\nfollowed. There was talk. Not good talk. There was no attempt at flippancy or false coquetry on\\nAdrian’s part this night; he recognized that they were in a lot of trouble.\\n“Give me that hat,” Garton said. “Give it to me, queer.”\\n“If I do, will you leave us alone?” Adrian was wheezing with fright, almost crying, looking from\\nUnwin to Dubay to Garton with terrified eyes.\\n“Just give me the fucker!”\\nAdrian handed it over. Garton produced a switchknife from the left front pocket of his jeans and\\ncut it into two pieces. He rubbed the pieces against the seat of his jeans. Then he dropped them to his\\nfeet and stomped them.\\nDon Hagarty backed away a little while their attention was divided between Adrian and the hat—\\nhe was looking, he said, for a cop.\\n“Now will you let us al—” Adrian Mellon began, and that was when Garton punched him in the\\nface, driving him back against the waist-high pedestrian railing of the bridge. Adrian screamed,\\nclapping his hands to his mouth. Blood poured through his fingers.\\n“Ade!” Hagarty cried, and ran forward again. Dubay tripped him. Garton booted him in the\\nstomach, knocking him off the sidewalk and into the roadway. A car passed. Hagarty rose to his knees\\nand screamed at it. It didn’t slow. The driver, he told Gardener and Reeves, never even looked\\naround.\\n“Shut up, queer!” Dubay said, and kicked him in the side of the face. Hagarty fell on his side in the\\ngutter, semiconscious.\\nA few moments later he heard a voice—Chris Unwin’s—telling him to get away before he got\\nwhat his friend was getting. In his own statement Unwin verified giving this warning.\\nHagarty could hear thudding blows and the sound of his lover screaming. Adrian sounded like a\\nrabbit in a snare, he told the police. Hagarty crawled back toward the intersection and the bright\\nlights of the bus station, and when he was a distance away he turned back to look.\\nAdrian Mellon, who stood about five-five and might have weighed a hundred and thirty-five\\npounds soaking wet, was being pushed from Garton to Dubay to Unwin in a kind of triple play. His\\nbody jittered and flopped like the body of a rag doll. They were punching him, pummelling him,\\nripping at his clothes. As he watched, he said, Garton punched Adrian in the crotch. Adrian’s hair\\nhung in his face. Blood poured out of his mouth and soaked his shirt. Webby Garton wore two heavy\\n\\n\\x0crings on his right hand: one was a Derry High School ring, the other one he had made in shop class—\\nan intertwined brass DB stood out three inches from this latter. The letters stood for the Dead Bugs, a\\nmetal band he particularly admired. The rings had torn Adrian’s upper lip open and shattered three of\\nhis upper teeth at the gum line.\\n“Help!” Hagarty shrieked. “Help! Help! They’re killing him! Help!”\\nThe buildings of Main Street loomed dark and secret. No one came to help—not even from the one\\nwhite island of light which marked the bus station, and Hagarty did not see how that could be: there\\nwere people in there. He had seen them when he and Ade walked past. Would none of them come to\\nhelp? None at all?\\n“HELP! HELP! THEY’RE KILLING HIM, HELP, PLEASE, FOR GOD’S SAKE!”\\n“Help,” a very small voice whispered from Don Hagarty’s left . . . and then there was a giggle.\\n“Bum’s rush!” Garton was yelling now . . . yelling and laughing. All three of them, Hagarty told\\nGardener and Reeves, had been laughing while they beat Adrian up. “Bum’s rush! Over the side!”\\n“Bum’s rush! Bum’s rush! Bum’s rush!” Dubay chanted, laughing.\\n“Help,” the small voice said again, and although the voice was grave, that little giggle followed\\nagain—it was like the voice of a child who cannot help itself.\\nHagarty looked down and saw the clown—and it was at this point that Gardener and Reeves began\\nto discount everything that Hagarty said, because the rest was the raving of a lunatic. Later, however,\\nHarold Gardener found himself wondering. Later, when he found that the Unwin boy had also seen a\\nclown—or said he had—he began to have second thoughts. His partner either never had them or\\nwould never admit to them.\\nThe clown, Hagarty said, looked like a cross between Ronald McDonald and that old TV clown,\\nBozo—or so he thought at first. It was the wild tufts of orange hair that brought such comparisons to\\nmind. But later consideration had caused him to think the clown really looked like neither. The smile\\npainted over the white pancake was red, not orange, and the eyes were a weird shiny silver. Contact\\nlenses, perhaps . . . but a part of him thought then and continued to think that maybe that silver had\\nbeen the real color of those eyes. He wore a baggy suit with big orange-pompom buttons; on his hands\\nwere cartoon gloves.\\n“If you need help, Don,” the clown said, “help yourself to a balloon.”\\nAnd it offered the bunch it held in one hand.\\n“They float,” the clown said. “Down here we all float; pretty soon your friend will float, too.”\\n\\n12\\n“This clown called you by name,” Jeff Reeves said in a totally expressionless voice. He looked over\\nHagarty’s bent head at Harold Gardener, and one eye drew down in a wink.\\n“Yes,” Hagarty said, not looking up. “I know how it sounds.”\\n\\n13\\n“So then you threw him over,” Boutillier said. “Bum’s rush.”\\n“Not me!” Unwin said, looking up. He flicked the hair out of his eyes with one hand and stared at\\nthem urgently. “When I saw they really meant to do it, I tried to pull Steve away, because I knew the\\nguy might get banged up. . . . It was like ten feet to the water. . . .”\\n\\n\\x0cIt was twenty-three. One of Chief Rademacher’s patrolmen had already measured.\\n“But it was like he was crazy. The two of them kept yelling ‘Bum’s rush! Bum’s rush!’ and they\\npicked him up. Webby had him under the arms and Steve had him by the seat of the pants, and . . .\\nand . . .”\\n\\n14\\nWhen Hagarty saw what they were doing, he rushed back toward them, screaming “No! No! No!” at\\nthe top of his voice.\\nChris Unwin pushed him backward and Hagarty landed in a teeth-rattling heap on the sidewalk.\\n“Do you want to go over, too?” he whispered. “You run, baby!”\\nThey threw Adrian Mellon over the bridge and into the water then. Hagarty heard the splash.\\n“Let’s get out of here,” Steve Dubay said. He and Webby were backing toward the car.\\nChris Unwin went to the railing and looked over. He saw Hagarty first, sliding and clawing his\\nway down the weedy, trash-littered embankment to the water. Then he saw the clown. The clown was\\ndragging Adrian out on the far side with one arm; its balloons were in its other hand. Adrian was\\ndripping wet, choking, moaning. The clown twisted its head and grinned up at Chris. Chris said he\\nsaw its shining silver eyes and its bared teeth—great big teeth, he said.\\n“Like the lion in the circus, man,” he said. “I mean, they were that big.”\\nThen, he said, he saw the clown shove one of Adrian Mellon’s arms back so it lay over his head.\\n“Then what, Chris?” Boutillier said. He was bored with this part. Fairytales had bored him since\\nthe age of eight on.\\n“I dunno,” Chris said. “That was when Steve grabbed me and hauled me into the car. But . . . I\\nthink it bit into his armpit.” He looked up at them again, uncertain now. “I think that’s what it did. Bit\\ninto his armpit.\\n“Like it wanted to eat him, man. Like it wanted to eat his heart.”\\n\\n15\\nNo, Hagarty said when he was presented with Chris Unwin’s story in the form of questions. The\\nclown did not drag Ade up on the far bank, at least not that he saw—and he would grant that he had\\nbeen something less than a disinterested observer by that point; by that point he had been out of his\\nfucking mind.\\nThe clown, he said, was standing near the far bank with Adrian’s dripping body clutched in its\\narms. Ade’s right arm was stuck stiffly out behind the clown’s head, and the clown’s face was indeed\\nin Ade’s right armpit, but it was not biting: it was smiling. Hagarty could see it looking out from\\nbeneath Ade’s arm and smiling.\\nThe clown’s arms tightened, and Hagarty heard ribs splinter.\\nAde shrieked.\\n“Float with us, Don,” the clown said out of its grinning red mouth, and then pointed with one of its\\nwhite-gloved hands under the bridge.\\nBalloons floated against the underside of the bridge—not a dozen or a dozen dozens but thousands,\\nred and blue and green and yellow, and printed on the side of each was I DERRY!\\n\\n\\x0c16\\n“Well now, that surely does sound like a lot of balloons,” Reeves said, and tipped Harold Gardener\\nanother wink.\\n“I know how it sounds,” Hagarty reiterated in the same dreary voice.\\n“You saw those balloons,” Gardener said.\\nDon Hagarty slowly held his hands up in front of his face. “I saw them as clearly as I can see my\\nown fingers at this moment. Thousands of them. You couldn’t even see the underside of the bridge—\\nthere were too many of them. They were rippling a little, and sort of bouncing up and down. There\\nwas a sound. A funny low squealing noise. That was their sides rubbing together. And strings. There\\nwas a forest of white strings hanging down. They looked like white strands of spiderweb. The clown\\ntook Ade under there. I could see its suit brushing through those strings. Ade was making awful\\nchoking sounds. I started after him . . . and the clown looked back. I saw its eyes, and all at once I\\nunderstood who it was.”\\n“Who was it, Don?” Harold Gardener asked softly.\\n“It was Derry,” Don Hagarty said. “It was this town.”\\n“And what did you do then?” It was Reeves.\\n“I ran, you dumb shit,” Hagarty said, and burst into tears.\\n\\n17\\nHarold Gardener kept his peace until November 13th, the day before John Garton and Steven Dubay\\nwere to go on trial in Derry District Court for the murder of Adrian Mellon. Then he went to see Tom\\nBoutillier. He wanted to talk about the clown. Boutillier didn’t—but when he saw Gardener might do\\nsomething stupid without a little guidance, he did.\\n“There was no clown, Harold. The only clowns out that night were those three kids. You know that\\nas well as I do.”\\n“We have two witnesses—”\\n“Oh, that’s crap. Unwin decided to bring on the One-Armed Man, as in ‘We didn’t kill the poor\\nlittle faggot, it was the one-armed man,’ as soon as he understood he’d really gotten his buns into\\nsome hot water this time. Hagarty was hysterical. He stood by and watched those kids murder his best\\nfriend. It wouldn’t have surprised me if he’d seen flying saucers.”\\nBut Boutillier knew better. Gardener could see it in his eyes, and the Assistant D.A.’s ducking and\\ndodging irritated him.\\n“Come on,” he said. “We’re talking about independent witnesses here. Don’t bullshit me.”\\n“Oh, you want to talk bullshit? Are you telling me you believe there was a vampire clown under\\nthe Main Street Bridge? Because that’s my idea of bullshit.”\\n“No, not exactly, but—”\\n“Or that Hagarty saw a billion balloons under there, each imprinted with exactly the same thing as\\nwhat was written on his lover’s hat? Because that is also my idea of bullshit.”\\n“No, but—”\\n“Then why are you bothering with this?”\\n“Stop cross-examining me!” Gardener roared. “They both described it the same and neither knew\\nwhat the other one was saying!”\\n\\n\\x0cBoutillier had been sitting at his desk, playing with a pencil. Now he put the pencil down, got up,\\nand walked over to Harold Gardener. Boutillier was five inches shorter, but Gardener retreated a\\nstep before the man’s anger.\\n“Do you want us to lose this case, Harold?”\\n“No. Of course n—”\\n“Do you want those running sores to walk free?”\\n“No!”\\n“Okay. Good. Since we both agree on the basics, I’ll tell you exactly what I think. Yes, there was\\nprobably a man under the bridge that night. Maybe he was even wearing a clown suit, although I’ve\\ndealt with enough witnesses to guess maybe it was just a stewbum or a transient wearing a bunch of\\ncast-off clothes. I think he was probably down there scrounging for dropped change or roadmeat—\\nhalf a burger someone chucked over the side, or maybe the crumbs from the bottom of a Frito bag.\\nTheir eyes did the rest, Harold. Now is that possible?”\\n“I don’t know,” Harold said. He wanted to be convinced, but given the exact tally of the two\\ndescriptions . . . no. He didn’t think it was possible.\\n“Here’s the bottom line. I don’t care if it was Kinko the Klown or a guy in an Uncle Sam suit on\\nstilts or Hubert the Happy Homo. If we introduce this fellow into the case, their lawyer is going to be\\non it before you can say ‘Jack Robinson.’ He’s going to say those two little innocent lambs out there\\nwith their fresh haircuts and new suits didn’t do anything but toss that gay fellow Mellon over the side\\nof the bridge for a joke. He’ll point out that Mellon was still alive after he took the fall; they have\\nHagarty’s testimony as well as Unwin’s for that.\\n“His clients didn’t commit murder, oh no! It was a psycho in a clown suit. If we introduce this,\\nthat’s going to happen and you know it.”\\n“Unwin’s going to tell that story anyhow.”\\n“But Hagarty isn’t,” Boutillier said. “Because he understands. Without Hagarty, who’s going to\\nbelieve Unwin?”\\n“Well, there’s us,” Harold Gardener said with a bitterness that surprised even himself, “but I guess\\nwe’re not telling.”\\n“Oh, give me a break!” Boutillier roared, throwing up his hands, “They killed him! They didn’t\\njust throw him over the side—Garton had a switchblade. Mellon was stabbed seven times, including\\nonce in the left lung and twice in the testicles. The wounds match the blade. Four of his ribs were\\nbroken—Dubay did that, bear-hugging him. He was bitten, all right. There were bites on his arms, his\\nleft cheek, his neck. I think that was Unwin and Garton, although we’ve only got one clear match, and\\nthat one’s probably not clear enough to stand up in court. And so all right, there was a big chunk of\\nmeat gone from his right armpit, so what? One of them really liked to bite. Probably even got himself\\na pretty good bone-on while he was doing it. I’m betting Garton, although we’ll never prove it. And\\nMellon’s earlobe was gone.”\\nBoutillier stopped, glaring at Harold.\\n“If we let in this clown story we’ll never bring it home to them. Do you want that?”\\n“No, I told you.”\\n“The guy was a fruit, but he wasn’t hurting anyone,” Boutillier said. “So hi-ho-the-dairy-o, along\\ncome these three pusholes in their engineer boots and they steal his life. I’m going to put them in the\\nslam, my friend, and if I hear they got their puckery little assholes cored down there at Thomaston,\\nI’m gonna send them cards saying I hope whoever did it had AIDS.”\\n\\n\\x0cVery fiery, Gardener thought. And the convictions will also look very good on your record when\\nyou run for the top spot in two years.\\nBut he left without saying more, because he also wanted to see them put away.\\n\\n18\\nJohn Webber Garton was convicted of first-degree manslaughter and sentenced to ten to twenty years\\nin Thomaston State Prison.\\nSteven Bishoff Dubay was convicted of first-degree manslaughter and sentenced to fifteen years in\\nShawshank State Prison.\\nChristopher Philip Unwin was tried separately as a juvenile and convicted of second-degree\\nmanslaughter. He was sentenced to six months at the South Windham Boys’ Training Facility, sentence\\nsuspended.\\nAt the time of this writing, all three sentences are under appeal; Garton and Dubay may be seen on\\nany given day girl-watching or playing Penny Pitch in Bassey Park, not far from where Mellon’s torn\\nbody was found floating against one of the pilings of the Main Street Bridge.\\nDon Hagarty and Chris Unwin have left town.\\nAt the major trial—that of Garton and Dubay—no one mentioned a clown.\\n\\n\\x0cC HAP T ER 3\\n\\nSix Phone Calls (1985)\\n1\\nStanley Uris Takes a Bath\\nPatricia Uris later told her mother she should have known something was wrong. She should have\\nknown it, she said, because Stanley never took baths in the early evening. He showered early each\\nmorning and sometimes soaked late at night (with a magazine in one hand and a cold beer in the\\nother), but baths at 7:00 P.M. were not his style.\\nAnd then there was the thing about the books. It should have delighted him; instead, in some\\nobscure way she did not understand, it seemed to have upset and depressed him. About three months\\nbefore that terrible night, Stanley had discovered that a childhood friend of his had turned out to be a\\nwriter—not a real writer, Patricia told her mother, but a novelist. The name on the books was\\nWilliam Denbrough, but Stanley had sometimes called him Stuttering Bill. He had worked his way\\nthrough almost all of the man’s books; had, in fact, been reading the last on the night of the bath—the\\nnight of May 28th, 1985. Patty herself had picked up one of the earlier ones, out of curiosity. She had\\nput it down after just three chapters.\\nIt had not just been a novel, she told her mother later; it had been a horrorbook. She said it just that\\nway, all one word, the way she would have said sexbook. Patty was a sweet, kind woman, but not\\nterribly articulate—she had wanted to tell her mother how much that book had frightened her and why\\nit had upset her, but had not been able. “It was full of monsters,” she said. “Full of monsters chasing\\nafter little children. There were killings, and . . . I don’t know . . . bad feelings and hurt. Stuff like\\nthat.” It had, in fact, struck her as almost pornographic; that was the word which kept eluding her,\\nprobably because she had never in her life spoken it, although she knew what it meant. “But Stan felt\\nas if he’d rediscovered one of his childhood chums. . . . He talked about writing to him, but I knew he\\nwouldn’t. . . . I knew those stories made him feel bad, too . . . and . . . and . . .”\\nAnd then Patty Uris began to cry.\\nThat night, lacking roughly six months of being twenty-eight years from the day in 1957 when\\nGeorge Denbrough had met Pennywise the Clown, Stanley and Patty had been sitting in the den of\\ntheir home in a suburb of Atlanta. The TV was on. Patty was sitting in the love-seat in front of it,\\ndividing her attention between a pile of sewing and her favorite game-show, Family Feud. She\\nsimply adored Richard Dawson and thought the watch-chain he always wore was terribly sexy,\\nalthough wild horses would not have drawn this admission out of her. She also liked the show\\nbecause she almost always got the most popular answers (there were no right answers on Family\\nFeud, exactly; only the most popular ones). She had once asked Stan why the questions that seemed so\\neasy to her usually seemed so hard to the families on the show. “It’s probably a lot tougher when\\nyou’re up there under those lights,” Stanley had replied, and it seemed to her that a shadow had\\n\\n\\x0cdrifted over his face. “Everything’s a lot tougher when it’s for real. That’s when you choke. When it’s\\nfor real.”\\nThat was probably very true, she decided. Stanley had really fine insights into human nature\\nsometimes. Much finer, she considered, than his old friend William Denbrough, who had gotten rich\\nwriting a bunch of horrorbooks which appealed to people’s baser natures.\\nNot that the Urises were doing so badly themselves! The suburb where they lived was a fine one,\\nand the home which they had purchased for $87,000 in 1979 would probably now sell quickly and\\npainlessly for $165,000—not that she wanted to sell, but such things were good to know. She\\nsometimes drove back from the Fox Run Mall in her Volvo (Stanley drove a Mercedes diesel—\\nteasing him, she called it Sedanley) and saw her house, set tastefully back behind low yew hedges,\\nand thought: Who lives there? Why, I do! Mrs. Stanley Uris does! This was not an entirely happy\\nthought; mixed with it was a pride so fierce that it sometimes made her feel a bit ill. Once upon a\\ntime, you see, there had been a lonely eighteen-year-old girl named Patricia Blum who had been\\nrefused entry to the after-prom party that was held at the country club in the upstate town of Glointon,\\nNew York. She had been refused admission, of course, because her last name rhymed with plum. That\\nwas her, just a skinny little kike plum, 1967 that had been, and such discrimination was against the\\nlaw, of course, har-de-har-har-har, and besides, it was all over now. Except that for part of her it was\\nnever going to be over. Part of her would always be walking back to the car with Michael Rosenblatt,\\nlistening to the crushed gravel under her pumps and his rented formal shoes, back to his father’s car,\\nwhich Michael had borrowed for the evening, and which he had spent the afternoon waxing. Part of\\nher would always be walking next to Michael in his rented white dinner jacket—how it had\\nglimmered in the soft spring night! She had been in a pale green evening gown which her mother\\ndeclared made her look like a mermaid, and the idea of a kike mermaid was pretty funny, har-de-harhar-har. They had walked with their heads up and she had not wept—not then—but she had\\nunderstood they weren’t walking back, no, not really; what they had been doing was slinking back,\\nslinking, rhymes with stinking, both of them feeling more Jewish than they had ever felt in their lives,\\nfeeling like pawnbrokers, feeling like cattle-car riders, feeling oily, long-nosed, sallow-skinned;\\nfeeling like mockies sheenies kikes; wanting to feel angry and not being able to feel angry—the anger\\ncame only later, when it didn’t matter. At that moment she had only been able to feel ashamed, had\\nonly been able to ache. And then someone had laughed. A high shrill tittering laugh like a fast run of\\nnotes on a piano, and in the car she had been able to weep, oh you bet, here is the kike mermaid\\nwhose name rhymes with plum just weeping away like crazy. Mike Rosenblatt had put a clumsy,\\ncomforting hand on the back of her neck and she had twisted away from it, feeling ashamed, feeling\\ndirty, feeling Jewish.\\nThe house set so tastefully back behind the yew hedges made that better . . . but not all better. The\\nhurt and shame were still there, and not even being accepted in this quiet, sleekly well-to-do\\nneighborhood could quite make that endless walk with the sound of grating stones beneath their shoes\\nstop happening. Not even being members of this country club, where the maître d’ always greeted\\nthem with a quietly respectful “Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. Uris.” She would come home, cradled in\\nher 1984 Volvo, and she would look at her house sitting on its expanse of green lawn, and she would\\noften—all too often, she supposed—think of that shrill titter. And she would hope that the girl who\\nhad tittered was living in a shitty tract house with a goy husband who beat her, that she had been\\npregnant three times and had miscarried each time, that her husband cheated on her with diseased\\nwomen, that she had slipped discs and fallen arches and cysts on her dirty tittering tongue.\\n\\n\\x0cShe would hate herself for these thoughts, these uncharitable thoughts, and promise to do better—\\nto stop drinking these bitter gall-and-wormwood cocktails. Months would go by when she did not\\nthink such thoughts. She would think: Maybe all of that is finally past me. I am not that girl of\\neighteen anymore. I am a woman of thirty-six; the girl who heard the endless click and grate of\\nthose driveway stones, the girl who twisted away from Mike Rosenblatt’s hand when he tried to\\ncomfort her because it was a Jewish hand, was half a life ago. That silly little mermaid is dead. I\\ncan forget her now and just be myself. Okay. Good. Great. But then she would be somewhere—at the\\nsupermarket, maybe—and she would hear sudden tittering laughter from the next aisle and her back\\nwould prickle, her nipples would go hard and hurtful, her hands would tighten on the bar of the\\nshopping cart or just on each other, and she would think: Someone just told someone else that I’m\\nJewish, that I’m nothing but a bignose mockie kike, that Stanley’s nothing but a bignose mockie\\nkike, he’s an accountant, sure, Jews are good with numbers, we let them into the country club, we\\nhad to, back in 1981 when that bignose mockie gynecologist won his suit, but we laugh at them, we\\nlaugh and laugh and laugh. Or she would simply hear the phantom click and grate of stones and think\\nMermaid! Mermaid!\\nThen the hate and shame would come flooding back like a migraine headache and she would\\ndespair not only for herself but for the whole human race. Werewolves. The book by Denbrough—the\\none she had tried to read and then put aside—was about werewolves. Werewolves, shit. What did a\\nman like that know about werewolves?\\nMost of the time, however, she felt better than that—felt she was better than that. She loved her\\nman, she loved her house, and she was usually able to love her life and herself. Things were good.\\nThey had not always been that way, of course—were things ever? When she accepted Stanley’s\\nengagement ring, her parents had been both angry and unhappy. She had met him at a sorority party.\\nHe had come over to her school from New York State University, where he was a scholarship student.\\nThey had been introduced by a mutual friend, and by the time the evening was over, she suspected that\\nshe loved him. By the mid-term break, she was sure. When spring came around and Stanley offered\\nher a small diamond ring with a daisy pushed through it, she had accepted it.\\nIn the end, in spite of their qualms, her parents had accepted it as well. There was little else they\\ncould do, although Stanley Uris would soon be sallying forth into a job-market glutted with young\\naccountants—and when he went into that jungle, he would do so with no family finances to backstop\\nhim, and with their only daughter as his hostage to fortune. But Patty was twenty-two, a woman now,\\nand would herself soon graduate with a B.A.\\n“I’ll be supporting that four-eyed son of a bitch for the rest of my life,” Patty had heard her father\\nsay one night. Her mother and father had gone out for dinner, and her father had drunk a little too\\nmuch.\\n“Shh, she’ll hear you,” Ruth Blum said.\\nPatty had lain awake that night until long after midnight, dry-eyed, alternately hot and cold, hating\\nthem both. She had spent the next two years trying to get rid of that hate; there was too much hate\\ninside her already. Sometimes when she looked into the mirror she could see the things it was doing\\nto her face, the fine lines it was drawing there. That was a battle she won. Stanley had helped her.\\nHis own parents had been equally concerned about the marriage. They did not, of course, believe\\ntheir Stanley was destined for a life of squalor and poverty, but they thought “the kids were being\\nhasty.” Donald Uris and Andrea Bertoly had themselves married in their early twenties, but they\\nseemed to have forgotten the fact.\\n\\n\\x0cOnly Stanley had seemed sure of himself, confident of the future, unconcerned with the pitfalls\\ntheir parents saw strewn all about “the kids.” And in the end it was his confidence rather than their\\nfears which had been justified. In July of 1972, with the ink barely dry on her diploma, Patty had\\nlanded a job teaching shorthand and business English in Traynor, a small town forty miles south of\\nAtlanta. When she thought of how she had come by that job, it always struck her as a little—well,\\neerie. She had made a list of forty possibles from the ads in the teachers’ journals, then had written\\nforty letters over five nights—eight each evening—requesting further information on the job, and an\\napplication for each. Twenty-two replies indicated that the positions had been filled. In other cases, a\\nmore detailed explanation of the skills needed made it clear she wasn’t in the running; applying\\nwould only be a waste of her time and theirs. She had finished with a dozen possibles. Each looked\\nas likely as any other. Stanley had come in while she was puzzling over them and wondering if she\\ncould possibly manage to fill out a dozen teaching applications without going totally bonkers. He\\nlooked at the strew of papers on the table and then tapped the letter from the Traynor Superintendent\\nof Schools, a letter which to her looked no more or less encouraging than any of the others.\\n“There,” he said.\\nShe looked up at him, startled by the simple certainty in his voice. “Do you know something about\\nGeorgia that I don’t?”\\n“Nope. Only time I was ever there was at the movies.”\\nShe looked at him, an eyebrow cocked.\\n“Gone with the Wind. Vivien Leigh. Clark Gable. ‘I will think about it tomorrow, for tomorrow is\\nanothah day.’ Do I sound like I come from the South, Patty?”\\n“Yes. South Bronx. If you don’t know anything about Georgia and you’ve never been there, then\\nwhy—”\\n“Because it’s right.”\\n“You can’t know that, Stanley.”\\n“Sure I can,” he said simply. “I do.” Looking at him, she had seen he wasn’t joking: he really\\nmeant it. She had felt a ripple of unease go up her back.\\n“How do you know?”\\nHe had been smiling a little. Now the smile faltered, and for a moment he had seemed puzzled. His\\neyes had darkened, as if he looked inward, consulting some interior device which ticked and whirred\\ncorrectly but which, ultimately, he understood no more than the average man understands the workings\\nof the watch on his wrist.\\n“The turtle couldn’t help us,” he said suddenly. He said that quite clearly. She heard it. That\\ninward look—that look of surprised musing—was still on his face, and it was starting to scare her.\\n“Stanley? What are you talking about? Stanley?”\\nHe jerked. She had been eating peaches as she went over the applications, and his hand struck the\\ndish. It fell on the floor and broke. His eyes seemed to clear.\\n“Oh, shit! I’m sorry.”\\n“It’s all right. Stanley—what were you talking about?”\\n“I forget,” he said. “But I think we ought to think Georgia, babylove.”\\n“But—”\\n“Trust me,” he said, so she did.\\nHer interview had gone smashingly. She had known she had the job when she got on the train back\\nto New York. The head of the Business Department had taken an instant liking to Patty, and she to him;\\n\\n\\x0cshe had almost heard the click. The confirming letter had come a week later. The Traynor\\nConsolidated School Department could offer her $9,200 and a probationary contract.\\n“You are going to starve,” Herbert Blum said when his daughter told him she intended to take the\\njob. “And you will be hot while you starve.”\\n“Fiddle-dee-dee, Scarlett,” Stanley said when she told him what her father had said. She had been\\nfurious, near tears, but now she began to giggle, and Stanley swept her into his arms.\\nHot they had been; starved they had not. They were married on August 19th, 1972. Patty Uris had\\ngone to her marriage bed a virgin. She had slipped naked between cool sheets at a resort hotel in the\\nPoconos, her mood turbulent and stormy—lightning-flares of wanting and delicious lust, dark clouds\\nof fright. When Stanley slid into bed beside her, ropy with muscle, his penis an exclamation point\\nrising from gingery pubic hair, she had whispered: “Don’t hurt me, dear.”\\n“I will never hurt you,” he said as he took her in his arms, and it was a promise he had kept\\nfaithfully until May 28th, 1985—the night of the bath.\\nHer teaching had gone well. Stanley got a job driving a bakery truck for one hundred dollars a\\nweek. In November of that year, when the Traynor Flats Shopping Center opened, he got a job with\\nthe H & R Block office out there for a hundred and fifty. Their combined income was then $17,000 a\\nyear—this seemed a king’s ransom to them, in those days when gas sold for thirty-five cents a gallon\\nand a loaf of white bread could be had for a nickel less than that. In March of 1973, with no fuss and\\nno fanfare, Patty Uris had thrown away her birth-control pills.\\nIn 1975 Stanley quit H & R Block and opened his own business. All four in-laws agreed that this\\nwas a foolhardy move. Not that Stanley should not have his own business—God forbid he should not\\nhave his own business! But it was too early, all of them agreed, and it put too much of the financial\\nburden on Patty. (“At least until the pisher knocks her up,” Herbert Blum told his brother morosely\\nafter a night of drinking in the kitchen, “and then I’ll be expected to carry them.”) The consensus of inlaw opinion on the matter was that a man should not even think about going into business for himself\\nuntil he had reached a more serene and mature age—seventy-eight, say.\\nAgain, Stanley seemed almost preternaturally confident. He was young, personable, bright, apt. He\\nhad made contacts working for Block. All of these things were givens. But he could not have known\\nthat Corridor Video, a pioneer in the nascent videotape business, was about to settle on a huge patch\\nof farmed-out land less than ten miles from the suburb to which the Urises had eventually moved in\\n1979, nor could he have known that Corridor would be in the market for an independent marketing\\nsurvey less than a year after its move to Traynor. Even if Stan had been privy to some of this\\ninformation, he surely could not have believed they would give the job to a young, bespectacled Jew\\nwho also happened to be a damyankee—a Jew with an easy grin, a hipshot way of walking, a taste for\\nbell-bottomed jeans on his days off, and the last ghosts of his adolescent acne still on his face. Yet\\nthey had. They had. And it seemed that Stan had known it all along.\\nHis work for CV led to an offer of a full-time position with the company—starting salary, $30,000\\na year.\\n“And that really is only the start,” Stanley told Patty in bed that night. “They are going to grow like\\ncorn in August, my dear. If no one blows up the world in the next ten years or so, they are going to be\\nright up there on the big board along with Kodak and Sony and RCA.”\\n“So what are you going to do?” she asked, already knowing.\\n“I am going to tell them what a pleasure it was to do business with them,” he said, and laughed,\\nand drew her close, and kissed her. Moments later he mounted her, and there were climaxes—one,\\ntwo, and three, like bright rockets going off in a night sky . . . but there was no baby.\\n\\n\\x0cHis work with Corridor Video had brought him into contact with some of Atlanta’s richest and\\nmost powerful men—and they were both astonished to find that these men were mostly okay. In them\\nthey found a degree of acceptance and broad-minded kindliness that was almost unknown in the\\nNorth. Patty remembered Stanley once writing home to his mother and father: The best rich men in\\nAmerica live in Atlanta, Georgia. I am going to help make some of them richer, and they are going\\nto make me richer, and no one is going to own me except my wife, Patricia, and since I already\\nown her, I guess that is safe enough.\\nBy the time they moved from Traynor, Stanley was incorporated and employed six people. In 1983\\ntheir income had entered unknown territory—territory of which Patty had heard only the dimmest\\nrumors. This was the fabled land of SIX FIGURES. And it had all happened with the casual ease of\\nslipping into a pair of sneakers on Saturday morning. This sometimes frightened her. Once she had\\nmade an uneasy joke about deals with the devil. Stanley had laughed until he almost choked, but to her\\nit hadn’t seemed that funny, and she supposed it never would.\\nThe turtle couldn’t help us.\\nSometimes, for no reason at all, she would wake up with this thought in her mind like the last\\nfragment of an otherwise forgotten dream, and she would turn to Stanley, needing to touch him,\\nneeding to make sure he was still there.\\nIt was a good life—there was no wild drinking, no outside sex, no drugs, no boredom, no bitter\\narguments about what to do next. There was only a single cloud. It was her mother who first\\nmentioned the presence of this cloud. That her mother would be the one to finally do so seemed, in\\nretrospect, preordained. It finally came out as a question in one of Ruth Blum’s letters. She wrote\\nPatty once a week, and that particular letter had arrived in the early fall of 1979. It came forwarded\\nfrom the old Traynor address and Patty read it in a living room filled with cardboard liquor-store\\ncartons from which spilled their possessions, looking forlorn and uprooted and dispossessed.\\nIn most ways it was the usual Ruth Blum Letter from Home: four closely written blue pages, each\\none headed JUST A NOTE FROM RUTH. Her scrawl was nearly illegible, and Stanley had once\\ncomplained he could not read a single word his mother-in-law wrote. “Why would you want to?”\\nPatty had responded.\\nThis one was full of Mom’s usual brand of news; for Ruth Blum recollection was a broad delta,\\nspreading out from the moving point of the now in an ever-widening fan of interlocking relationships.\\nMany of the people of whom her mother wrote were beginning to fade in Patty’s memory like\\nphotographs in an old album, but to Ruth all of them remained fresh. Her concerns for their health and\\nher curiosity about their various doings never seemed to wane, and her prognoses were unfailingly\\ndire. Her father was still having too many stomach-aches. He was sure it was just dyspepsia; the idea\\nthat he might have an ulcer, she wrote, would not cross his mind until he actually began coughing up\\nblood and probably not even then. You know your father, dear—he works like a mule, and he also\\nthinks like one sometimes, God should forgive me for saying so. Randi Harlengen had gotten her\\ntubes tied, they took cysts as big as golfballs out of her ovaries, no malignancy, thank God, but\\ntwenty-seven ovarian cysts, could you die? It was the water in New York City, she was quite sure of\\nthat—the city air was dirty, too, but she was convinced it was the water that really got to you after\\nawhile. It built up deposits inside a person. She doubted if Patty knew how often she had thanked God\\nthat “you kids” were out in the country, where both air and water—but particularly the water—were\\nhealthier (to Ruth all of the South, including Atlanta and Birmingham, was the country). Aunt\\nMargaret was feuding with the power company again. Stella Flanagan had gotten married again, some\\npeople never learned. Richie Huber had been fired again.\\n\\n\\x0cAnd in the middle of this chatty—and often catty—outpouring, in the middle of a paragraph,\\napropos of nothing which had gone before or which came after, Ruth Blum had casually asked the\\nDreaded Question: “So when are you and Stan going to make us grandparents? We’re all ready to\\nstart spoiling him (or her) rotten. And in case you hadn’t noticed, Patsy, we’re not getting any\\nyounger.” And then on to the Bruckner girl from down the block who had been sent home from school\\nbecause she was wearing no bra and a blouse that you could see right through.\\nFeeling low and homesick for their old place in Traynor, feeling unsure and more than a little\\nafraid of what might be ahead, Patty had gone into what was to become their bedroom and had lain\\ndown upon the mattress (the box spring was still out in the garage, and the mattress, lying all by itself\\non the big carpetless floor, looked like an artifact cast up on a strange yellow beach). She put her\\nhead in her arms and lay there weeping for nearly twenty minutes. She supposed that cry had been\\ncoming anyway. Her mother’s letter had just brought it on sooner, the way dust hurries the tickle in\\nyour nose into a sneeze.\\nStanley wanted kids. She wanted kids. They were as compatible on that subject as they were on\\ntheir enjoyment of Woody Allen’s films, their more or less regular attendance at synagogue, their\\npolitical leanings, their dislike of marijuana, a hundred other things both great and small. There had\\nbeen an extra room in the Traynor house, which they had split evenly down the middle. On the left he\\nhad a desk for working and a chair for reading; on the right she had a sewing machine and a cardtable\\nwhere she did jigsaw puzzles. There had been an agreement between them about that room so strong\\nthey rarely spoke of it—it was simply there, like their noses or the wedding rings on their left hands.\\nSomeday that room would belong to Andy or to Jenny. But where was that child? The sewing machine\\nand the baskets of fabric and the cardtable and the desk and the La-Z-Boy all kept their places,\\nseeming each month to solidify their holds on their respective positions in the room and to further\\nestablish their legitimacy. So she thought, although she never could quite crystallize the thought; like\\nthe word pornographic, it was a concept that danced just beyond her ability to quantify. But she did\\nremember one time when she got her period, sliding open the cupboard under the bathroom sink to get\\na sanitary napkin; she remembered looking at the box of Stayfree pads and thinking that the box\\nlooked almost smug, seemed almost to be saying: Hello, Patty! We are your children. We are the only\\nchildren you will ever have, and we are hungry. Nurse us. Nurse us on blood.\\nIn 1976, three years after she had thrown away the last cycle of Ovral tablets, they saw a doctor\\nnamed Harkavay in Atlanta. “We want to know if there is something wrong,” Stanley said, “and we\\nwant to know if we can do anything about it if there is.”\\nThey took the tests. They showed that Stanley’s sperm was perky, that Patty’s eggs were fertile,\\nthat all the channels that were supposed to be open were open.\\nHarkavay, who wore no wedding ring and who had the open, pleasant, ruddy face of a college\\ngrad student just back from a midterm skiing vacation in Colorado, told them that maybe it was just\\nnerves. He told them that such a problem was by no means uncommon. He told them that there seemed\\nto be a psychological correlative in such cases that was in some ways similar to sexual impotency—\\nthe more you wanted to, the less you could. They would have to relax. They ought, if they could, to\\nforget all about procreation when they had sex.\\nStan was grumpy on the way home. Patty asked him why.\\n“I never do,” he said.\\n“Do what?”\\n“Think of procreation during.”\\n\\n\\x0cShe began to giggle, even though she was by then feeling a bit lonesome and frightened. And that\\nnight, lying in bed, long after she believed that Stanley must be asleep, he had frightened her by\\nspeaking out of the dark. His voice was flat but nevertheless choked with tears. “It’s me,” he said.\\n“It’s my fault.”\\nShe rolled toward him, groped for him, held him.\\n“Don’t be a stupid,” she said. But her heart was beating fast—much too fast. It wasn’t just that he\\nhad startled her; it was as if he had looked into her mind and read a secret conviction she held there\\nbut of which she had not known until this minute. With no rhyme, no reason, she felt—knew—that he\\nwas right. There was something wrong, and it wasn’t her. It was him. Something in him.\\n“Don’t be such a klutz,” she whispered fiercely against his shoulder. He was sweating lightly and\\nshe became suddenly aware that he was afraid. The fear was coming off him in cold waves; lying\\nnaked with him was suddenly like lying naked in front of an open refrigerator.\\n“I’m not a klutz and I’m not being stupid,” he said in that same voice, which was simultaneously\\nflat and choked with emotion, “and you know it. It’s me. But I don’t know why.”\\n“You can’t know any such thing.” Her voice was harsh, scolding—her mother’s voice when her\\nmother was afraid. And even as she scolded him a shudder ran through her body, twisting it like a\\nwhip. Stanley felt it and his arms tightened around her.\\n“Sometimes,” he said, “sometimes I think I know why. Sometimes I have a dream, a bad dream,\\nand I wake up and I think, ‘I know now. I know what’s wrong.’ Not just you not catching pregnant—\\neverything. Everything that’s wrong with my life.”\\n“Stanley, nothing’s wrong with your life!”\\n“I don’t mean from inside,” he said. “From inside is fine. I’m talking about outside. Something that\\nshould be over and isn’t. I wake up from these dreams and think, ‘My whole pleasant life has been\\nnothing but the eye of some storm I don’t understand.’ I’m afraid. But then it just . . . fades. The way\\ndreams do.”\\nShe knew that he sometimes dreamed uneasily. On half a dozen occasions he had awakened her,\\nthrashing and moaning. Probably there had been other times when she had slept through his dark\\ninterludes. Whenever she reached for him, asked him, he said the same thing: I can’t remember. Then\\nhe would reach for his cigarettes and smoke sitting up in bed, waiting for the residue of the dream to\\npass through his pores like bad sweat.\\nNo kids. On the night of May 28th, 1985—the night of the bath—their assorted in-laws were still\\nwaiting to be grandparents. The extra room was still an extra room; the Stayfree Maxis and Stayfree\\nMinis still occupied their accustomed places in the cupboard under the bathroom sink; the cardinal\\nstill paid its monthly visit. Her mother, who was much occupied with her own affairs but not entirely\\noblivious to her daughter’s pain, had stopped asking in her letters and when Stanley and Patty made\\ntheir twice-yearly trips back to New York. There were no more humorous remarks about whether or\\nnot they were taking their vitamin E. Stanley had also stopped mentioning babies, but sometimes,\\nwhen she didn’t know he was looking, she saw a shadow on his face. Some shadow. As if he were\\ntrying desperately to remember something.\\nOther than that one cloud, their lives were pleasant enough until the phone rang during the middle\\nof Family Feud on the night of May 28th. Patty had six of Stan’s shirts, two of her blouses, her sewing\\nkit, and her odd-button box; Stan had the new William Denbrough novel, not even out in paperback\\nyet, in his hands. There was a snarling beast on the front of this book. On the back was a bald man\\nwearing glasses.\\nStan was sitting nearer the phone. He picked it up and said, “Hello—Uris residence.”\\n\\n\\x0cHe listened, and a frown line delved between his eyebrows. “Who did you say?”\\nPatty felt an instant of fright. Later, shame would cause her to lie and tell her parents that she had\\nknown something was wrong from the instant the telephone had rung, but in reality there had only been\\nthat one instant, that one quick look up from her sewing. But maybe that was all right. Maybe they had\\nboth suspected that something was coming long before that phone call, something that didn’t fit with\\nthe nice house set tastefully back behind the low yew hedges, something so much a given that it really\\ndidn’t need much of an acknowledgment . . . that one sharp instant of fright, like the stab of a quickly\\nwithdrawn icepick, was enough.\\nIs it Mom? she mouthed at him in that instant, thinking that perhaps her father, twenty pounds\\noverweight and prone to what he called “the bellyache” since his early forties, had had a heart attack.\\nStan shook his head at her, and then smiled a bit at something the voice on the phone was saying.\\n“You . . . you! Well, I’ll be goddamned! Mike! How did y—”\\nHe fell silent again, listening. As his smile faded she recognized—or thought she did—his analytic\\nexpression, the one which said someone was unfolding a problem or explaining a sudden change in an\\nongoing situation or telling him something strange and interesting. This last was probably the case,\\nshe gathered. A new client? An old friend? Perhaps. She turned her attention back to the TV, where a\\nwoman was flinging her arms around Richard Dawson and kissing him madly. She thought that\\nRichard Dawson must get kissed even more than the Blarney stone. She also thought she wouldn’t\\nmind kissing him herself.\\nAs she began searching for a black button to match the ones on Stanley’s blue denim shirt, Patty\\nwas vaguely aware that the conversation was settling into a smoother groove—Stanley grunted\\noccasionally, and once he asked: “Are you sure, Mike?” Finally, after a very long pause, he said, “All\\nright, I understand. Yes, I . . . Yes. Yes, everything. I have the picture. I . . . what? . . . No, I can’t\\nabsolutely promise that, but I’ll consider it carefully. You know that . . . oh? . . . He did? . . . Well, you\\nbet! Of course I do. Yes . . . sure . . . thank you . . . yes. Bye-bye.” He hung up.\\nPatty glanced at him and saw him staring blankly into space over the TV set. On her show, the\\naudience was applauding the Ryan family, which had just scored two hundred and eighty points, most\\nof them by guessing that the audience survey would answer “math” in response to the question “What\\nclass will people say Junior hates most in school?” The Ryans were jumping up and down and\\nscreaming joyfully. Stanley, however, was frowning. She would later tell her parents she thought\\nStanley’s face had looked a little off-color, and so she did, but she neglected to tell them she had\\ndismissed it at the time as only a trick of the table-lamp, with its green glass shade.\\n“Who was that, Stan?”\\n“Hmmmm?” He looked around at her. She thought the look on his face was one of gentle\\nabstraction, perhaps mixed with minor annoyance. It was only later, replaying the scene in her mind\\nagain and again, that she began to believe it was the expression of a man who was methodically\\nunplugging himself from reality, one cord at a time. The face of a man who was heading out of the\\nblue and into the black.\\n“Who was that on the phone?”\\n“No one,” he said. “No one, really. I think I’ll take a bath.” He stood up.\\n“What, at seven o’clock?”\\nHe didn’t answer, only left the room. She might have asked him if something was wrong, might\\neven have gone after him and asked him if he was sick to his stomach—he was sexually uninhibited,\\nbut he could be oddly prim about other things, and it wouldn’t be at all unlike him to say he was going\\nto take a bath when what he really had to do was whoops something which hadn’t agreed with him.\\n\\n\\x0cBut now a new family, the Piscapos, were being introduced, and Patty just knew Richard Dawson\\nwould find something funny to say about that name, and besides, she was having the devil’s own time\\nfinding a black button, although she knew there were loads of them in the button box. They hid, of\\ncourse; that was the only explanation. . . .\\nSo she let him go and did not think of him again until the credit-crawl, when she looked up and\\nsaw his empty chair. She had heard the water running into the tub upstairs and had heard it stop five\\nor ten minutes later . . . but now she realized she had never heard the fridge door open and close, and\\nthat meant he was up there without a can of beer. Someone had called him up and dropped a big fat\\nproblem in his lap, and had she offered him a single word of commiseration? No. Tried to draw him\\nout a little about it? No. Even noticed that something was wrong? For the third time, no. All because\\nof that stupid TV show—she couldn’t even really blame the buttons; they were only an excuse.\\nOkay—she’d take him up a can of Dixie, and sit beside him on the edge of the tub, scrub his back,\\nplay Geisha and wash his hair if he wanted her to, and find out just what the problem was . . . or who\\nit was.\\nShe got a can of beer out of the fridge and went upstairs with it. The first real disquiet stirred in\\nher when she saw that the bathroom door was shut. Not just part-way closed but shut tight. Stanley\\nnever closed the door when he was taking a bath. It was something of a joke between them—the\\nclosed door meant he was doing something his mother had taught him, the open door meant he would\\nnot be averse to doing something the teaching of which his mother had quite properly left to others.\\nPatty tapped on the door with her nails, suddenly aware, too aware, of the reptilian clicking sound\\nthey made on the wood. And surely tapping on the bathroom door, knocking like a guest, was\\nsomething she had never done before in her married life—not here, not on any other door in the house.\\nThe disquiet suddenly grew strong in her, and she thought of Carson Lake, where she had gone\\nswimming often as a girl. By the first of August the lake was as warm as a tub . . . but then you’d hit a\\ncold pocket that would shiver you with surprise and delight. One minute you were warm; the next\\nmoment it felt as if the temperature had plummeted twenty degrees below your hips. Minus the\\ndelight, that was how she felt now—as if she had just struck a cold pocket. Only this cold pocket was\\nnot below her hips, chilling her long teenager’s legs in the black depths of Carson Lake.\\nThis one was around her heart.\\n“Stanley? Stan?”\\nThis time she did more than tap with her nails. She rapped on the door. When there was still no\\nanswer, she hammered on it.\\n“Stanley?”\\nHer heart. Her heart wasn’t in her chest anymore. It was beating in her throat, making it hard to\\nbreathe.\\n“Stanley!”\\nIn the silence following her shout (and just the sound of herself shouting up here, less than thirty\\nfeet from the place where she laid her head down and went to sleep each night, frightened her even\\nmore), she heard a sound which brought panic up from the belowstairs part of her mind like an\\nunwelcome guest. Such a small sound, really. It was only the sound of dripping water. Plink . . .\\npause. Plink . . . pause. Plink . . . pause. Plink . . .\\nShe could see the drops forming on the snout of the faucet, growing heavy and fat there, growing\\npregnant there, and then falling off: plink.\\nJust that sound. No other. And she was suddenly, terribly sure that it had been Stanley, not her\\nfather, who had been stricken with a heart attack tonight.\\n\\n\\x0cWith a moan, she gripped the cut-glass doorknob and turned it. Yet still the door would not move:\\nit was locked. And suddenly three nevers occurred to Patty Uris in rapid succession: Stanley never\\ntook a bath in the early evening, Stanley never closed the door unless he was using the toilet, and\\nStanley had never locked the door against her at all.\\nWas it possible, she wondered crazily, to prepare for a heart attack?\\nPatty ran her tongue over her lips—it produced a sound in her head like fine sandpaper sliding\\nalong a board—and called his name again. There was still no answer except the steady, deliberate\\ndrip of the faucet. She looked down and saw she still held the can of Dixie beer in one hand. She\\ngazed at it stupidly, her heart running like a rabbit in her throat; she gazed at it as if she had never seen\\na can of beer in her whole life before this minute. And indeed it seemed she never had, or at least\\nnever one like this, because when she blinked her eyes it turned into a telephone handset, as black and\\nas threatening as a snake.\\n“May I help you, ma’am? Do you have a problem?” the snake spat at her. Patty slammed it down in\\nits cradle and stepped away, rubbing the hand which had held it. She looked around and saw she was\\nback in the TV room and understood that the panic which had come into the front of her mind like a\\nprowler walking quietly up a flight of stairs had had its way with her. Now she could remember\\ndropping the beer can outside the bathroom door and pelting headlong back down the stairs, thinking\\nvaguely: This is all a mistake of some kind and we’ll laugh about it later. He filled up the tub and\\nthen remembered he didn’t have cigarettes and went out to get them before he took his clothes off—\\nYes. Only he had already locked the bathroom door from the inside and because it was too much of\\na bother to unlock it again he had simply opened the window over the tub and gone down the side of\\nthe house like a fly crawling down a wall. Sure, of course, sure—\\nPanic was rising in her mind again—it was like bitter black coffee threatening to overflow the rim\\nof a cup. She closed her eyes and fought against it. She stood there, perfectly still, a pale statue with a\\npulse beating in its throat.\\nNow she could remember running back down here, feet stuttering on the stair-levels, running for\\nthe phone, oh yes, oh sure, but who had she meant to call?\\nCrazily, she thought: I would call the turtle, but the turtle couldn’t help us.\\nIt didn’t matter anyway. She had gotten as far as 0 and she must have said something not quite\\nstandard, because the operator had asked if she had a problem. She had one, all right, but how did you\\ntell that faceless voice that Stanley had locked himself in the bathroom and didn’t answer her, that the\\nsteady sound of the water dripping into the tub was killing her heart? Someone had to help her.\\nSomeone—\\nShe put the back of her hand into her mouth and deliberately bit down on it. She tried to think, tried\\nto force herself to think.\\nThe spare keys. The spare keys in the kitchen cupboard.\\nShe got going, and one slippered foot kicked the bag of buttons resting beside her chair. Some of\\nthe buttons spilled out, glittering like glazed eyes in the lamplight. She saw at least half a dozen black\\nones.\\nMounted inside the door of the cupboard over the double-basin sink was a large varnished board\\nin the shape of a key—one of Stan’s clients had made it in his workshop and given it to him two\\nChristmases ago. The key-board was studded with small hooks, and swinging on these were all the\\nkeys the house took, two duplicates of each to a hook. Beneath each hook was a strip of Mystik tape,\\neach strip lettered in Stan’s small, neat printing: GARAGE, ATTIC, D’STAIRS BATH, UPSTAIRS BATH, FRONT\\nDOOR, BACK DOOR. Off to one side were ignition-key dupes labelled M-B and VOLVO.\\n\\n\\x0cPatty snatched the key marked UPSTAIRS BATH, began to run for the stairs, and then made herself\\nwalk. Running made the panic want to come back, and the panic was too close to the surface as it\\nwas. Also, if she just walked, maybe nothing would be wrong. Or, if there was something wrong, God\\ncould look down, see she was just walking, and think: Oh, good—I pulled a hell of a boner, but I’ve\\ngot time to take it all back.\\nWalking as sedately as a woman on her way to a Ladies’ Book Circle meeting, she went up the\\nstairs and down to the closed bathroom door.\\n“Stanley?” she called, trying the door again at the same time, suddenly more afraid than ever, not\\nwanting to use the key because having to use the key was somehow too final. If God hadn’t taken it\\nback by the time she used the key, then He never would. The age of miracles, after all, was past.\\nBut the door was still locked; the deliberate plink . . . pause of dripping water was her only\\nanswer.\\nHer hand was shaking, and the key chattered all the way around the plate before finding its way\\ninto the keyhole and socking itself home. She turned it and heard the lock snap back. She fumbled for\\nthe cut-glass knob. It tried to slide through her hand again—not because the door was locked this time\\nbut because her palm was wet with sweat. She firmed her grip and made it turn. She pushed the door\\nopen.\\n“Stanley? Stanley? St—”\\nShe looked at the tub with its blue shower curtain bunched at the far end of the stainless steel rod\\nand forgot how to finish her husband’s name. She simply stared at the tub, her face as solemn as the\\nface of a child on her first day at school. In a moment she would begin to scream, and Anita\\nMacKenzie next door would hear her, and it would be Anita MacKenzie who would call the police,\\nconvinced that someone had broken into the Uris house and that people were being killed over there.\\nBut for now, this one moment, Patty Uris simply stood silent with her hands clasped in front of her\\nagainst her dark cotton skirt, her face solemn, her eyes huge. And now the look of almost holy\\nsolemnity began to transform itself into something else. The huge eyes began to bulge. Her mouth\\npulled back into a dreadful grin of horror. She wanted to scream and couldn’t. The screams were too\\nbig to come out.\\nThe bathroom was lit by fluorescent tubes. It was very bright. There were no shadows. You could\\nsee everything, whether you wanted to or not. The water in the tub was bright pink. Stanley lay with\\nhis back propped against the rear of the tub. His head had rolled so far back on his neck that strands\\nof his short black hair brushed the skin between his shoulder-blades. If his staring eyes had still been\\ncapable of seeing, she would have looked upside down to him. His mouth hung open like a sprung\\ndoor. His expression was one of abysmal, frozen horror. A package of Gillette Platinum Plus razor\\nblades lay on the rim of the tub. He had slit his inner forearms open from wrist to the crook of the\\nelbow, and then had crossed each of these cuts just below the Bracelets of Fortune, making a pair of\\nbloody capital T’s. The gashes glared red-purple in the harsh white light. She thought the exposed\\ntendons and ligaments looked like cuts of cheap beef.\\nA drop of water gathered at the lip of the shiny chromium faucet. It grew fat. Grew pregnant, you\\nmight say. It sparkled. It dropped. Plink.\\nHe had dipped his right forefinger in his own blood and had written a single word on the blue tiles\\nabove the tub, written it in two huge, staggering letters. A zig-zagging bloody fingermark fell away\\nfrom the second letter of this word—his finger had made that mark, she saw, as his hand fell into the\\ntub, where it now floated. She thought Stanley must have made that mark—his final impression on the\\nworld—as he lost consciousness. It seemed to cry out at her:\\n\\n\\x0cAnother drop fell into the tub.\\nPlink.\\nThat did it. Patty Uris at last found her voice. Staring into her husband’s dead and sparkling eyes,\\nshe began to scream.\\n\\n2\\nRichard Tozier Takes a Powder\\nRich felt like he was doing pretty good until the vomiting started.\\nHe had listened to everything Mike Hanlon told him, said all the right things, answered Mike’s\\nquestions, even asked a few of his own. He was vaguely aware that he was doing one of his Voices—\\nnot a strange and outrageous one, like those he sometimes did on the radio (Kinky Briefcase, Sexual\\nAccountant was his own personal favorite, at least for the time being, and positive listener response\\non Kinky was almost as high as for his listeners’ all-time favorite, Colonel Buford Kissdrivel), but a\\nwarm, rich, confident Voice. An I’m-All-Right Voice. It sounded great, but it was a lie. Just like all\\nthe other Voices were lies.\\n“How much do you remember, Rich?” Mike asked him.\\n“Very little,” Rich said, and then paused. “Enough, I suppose.”\\n“Will you come?”\\n“I’ll come,” Rich said, and hung up.\\nHe sat in his study for a moment, leaning back in the chair behind his desk, looking out at the\\nPacific Ocean. A couple of kids were down on the left, horsing around on their surfboards, not really\\nriding them. There wasn’t much surf to ride.\\nThe clock on the desk—an expensive L.E.D. quartz that had been a gift from a record company rep\\n—said that it was 5:09 P.M.. on May 28th, 1985. It would, of course, be three hours later where Mike\\nwas calling from. Dark already. He felt a prickle of gooseflesh at that and he began to move, to do\\nthings. First, of course, he put on a record—not hunting, just grabbing blindly among the thousands\\nracked on the shelves. Rock and roll was almost as much a part of his life as the Voices, and it was\\nhard for him to do anything without music playing—and the louder the better. The record he grabbed\\nturned out to be a Motown retrospective. Marvin Gaye, one of the newer members of what Rich\\nsometimes called The All-Dead Band, came on singing “I Heard It Through the Grapevine.”\\n“Oooh-hoo, I bet you’re wond’rin’ how I knew. . . .”\\n“Not bad,” Rich said. He even smiled a little. This was bad, and it had admittedly knocked him for\\na loop, but he felt that he was going to be able to handle it. No sweat.\\nHe began getting ready to go back home. And at some point during the next hour it occurred to him\\nthat it was as if he had died and had yet been allowed to make all of his own final business\\n\\n\\x0cdispositions . . . not to mention his own funeral arrangements. And he felt as if he was doing pretty\\ngood. He tried the travel agent he used, thinking she would probably be on the freeway and headed\\nhome by now but taking a shot on the off-chance. For a wonder, he caught her in. He told her what he\\nneeded and she asked him for fifteen minutes.\\n“I owe you one, Carol,” he said. They had progressed from Mr. Tozier and Ms. Feeny to Rich and\\nCarol over the last three years—pretty chummy, considering they had never met face to face.\\n“All right, pay off,” she said. “Can you do Kinky Briefcase for me?”\\nWithout even pausing—if you had to pause to find your '"
