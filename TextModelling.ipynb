       "'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\\n\\nTheres a guy like me in every state and federal prison in America, I guess--Im\\nthe guy who can get it for you. Tailor made cigarettes, a bag of reefer if \\nyoure\\npartial to that, a bottle of brandy to celebrate your son or daughters high\\n\\nschool graduation, or anything else within reason, that is.  It wasnt always \\nthat way.\\n\\nI came to Shawshank when I was just twenty, and I am one of the few people in\\nour happy little family willing to own up to what he did.  I committed murder.  \\nI\\nput a large insurance policy on my wife -- who was three years older than I was \\n--\\nand then I fixed the brakes on the Chevrolet coupe her father had given us as a\\nwedding present.  It worked out exactly as I had planned -- except I hadnt \\nplanned\\n\\non her stopping to pick up the neighbor woman and the neighbor woman’s infant \\nson\\non their way down Castle Hill and into town.  The brakes let go and the car\\n\\ncrashed through the bushes at the edge of the town common, gathering speed.\\nBystanders said it must have been doing fifty or better when it hit the base of\\nthe Civil War statue and burst into flames.\\n\\nI also hadnt planned on getting caught, but caught I was.  I got a seasons \\npass\\ninto this place.  Maine has no death-penalty, but the District Attorney saw to \\nit\\nthat I was tried for all three deaths and given three life sentences, to run one\\nafter the other.  That fixed up any chance of parole I might have for a long,\\nlong time.  The judge called what I had done \"a hideous, heinous crime,\" and it\\nwas; but it is also in the past now.  You can look it up in the yellowing files\\n\\nof the Castle Rock Call, where the big headlines announcing my conviction look\\nsort of funny and antique next to the news of Hitler and Mussolini and FDRs\\nalphabet soup agencies.\\n\\nHave I rehabilitated myself, you ask?  I dont even know what that word means, \\nat\\nleast as far as prisons and corrections go.  I think its a politicians word.  \\nIt\\n\\nmay have some other meaning, and it may be that I will have a chance to find\\nout, but that is the future - something cons teach themselves not to think\\n\\nabout.  I was young, good-looking, and from the poor side of town.  I knocked \\nup a\\npretty, sulky, headstrong girl who lived in one of the fine old houses on\\n\\nCarbine Street.  Her father was agreeable to the marriage if I would take a job\\n\\nin the optical company he owned and \"work my way up.\"  I found out that what he\\nreally had in mind was keeping me in his house and under his thumb, like a\\ndisagreeable pet that has not quite been housebroken and which may bite.  Enough\\nhate eventually piled up to cause me to do what I did.  Given a second chance, I\\nwould not do it again, but Im not sure that means I am rehabilitated.\\n\\nAnyway, its not me I want to tell you about; I want to tell you about a guy\\nnamed Andy Dufresne.  But before I can tell you about Andy, I have to explain a\\nfew other things about myself.  It wont take long.\\n\\nAs I said, Ive been the guy who can get it for you here at Shawshank for damn\\nnear forty years.  And that doesnt just mean contraband items like extra\\n\\n\\ncigarettes or booze, although those items always top the list. But Ive gotten\\nthousands of other items for men doing time here, some of them perfectly legal\\nyet   hard to come by in a place where youve supposedly been brought to be\\npunished.  There was one fellow who was in for raping a little girl and exposing\\nhimself to dozens of others; I got him three pieces of pink Vermont marble and\\nhe  did three lovely sculptures out of them - a baby, a boy of about twelve, \\nand a\\n\\nbearded young man.  He called them The Three Ages of Jesus, and those pieces of\\nsculpture are now in the parlor of a man who used to be governor of this state.\\n\\nOr heres a name you may remember if you grew up north of Massachusetts-Robert\\nAlan Cote.  In 1951 he tried to rob the First Mercantile Bank of Mechanic Falls,\\nand the holdup turned into a bloodbath - six dead in the end, two of them \\nmembers\\nof the gang, three of them hostages, one of them a young state cop who put his\\nhead up at the wrong time and got a bullet in the eye.  Cote had a penny\\n\\ncollection.  Naturally they werent going to let him have it in here, but with a\\nlittle help from his mother and a middleman who used to drive a laundry truck, I\\nwas able to get it for him.  I told him, Bobby, you must be crazy, wanting to\\nhave a coin collection in a stone hotel full of thieves.  He looked at me and\\nsmiled and said, I know where to keep them.  Theyll be safe enough.  Dont you\\n\\nworry.  And he was right.  Bobby Cote died of a brain tumor in 1967, but that \\ncoin\\ncollection has never turned up.\\n\\nIve gotten men chocolates on Valentines Day; I got three of those green\\nmilkshakes they serve at McDonalds around St. Paddys Day for a crazy Irishman\\nnamed OMalley; I even arranged for a midnight showing of Deep Throat and The\\nDevil in Miss Jones for a party of twenty men who had pooled their resources to\\nrent the films . . . although I ended up doing a week in solitary for that\\n\\nlittle escapade.  Its the risk you run when youre the guy who can get it.\\n\\nIve gotten reference books and fuck-books, joke novelties like hand-buzzers and\\nitching powder, and on more than one occasion Ive seen that a long-timer has\\ngotten a pair of panties from his wife or his girlfriend . . . and I guess\\n\\nyoull know what guys in here do with such items during the long nights when\\ntime draws out like a blade.  I dont get all those things gratis, and for some\\nitems the price comes high.  But I dont do it just for the money; what good is\\n\\nmoney to me?  Im never going to own a Cadillac car or fly off to Jamaica for \\ntwo\\nweeks in February.  I do it for the same reason that a good butcher will only\\n\\nsell you fresh meat: I got a reputation and I want to keep it.  The only two\\nthings I refuse to handle are guns and heavy drugs.  I wont help anyone kill\\nhimself or anyone else.  I have enough killing on my mind to last me a \\nlifetime.\\n\\nYeah, Im a regular Neiman-Marcus.  And so when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949\\nand asked if I could smuggle Rita Hayworth into the prison for him, I said it\\n\\nwould be no problem at all.  And it wasnt.\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\nWhen Andy came to Shawshank in 1948, he was thirty years old.  He was a short,\\nneat little man with sandy hair and small, clever hands.  He wore gold-rimmed\\nspectacles.  His fingernails were always clipped, and they were always clean.\\n\\nThats a funny thing to remember about a man, I suppose, but it seems to sum\\nAndy up for me.  He always looked as if he should have been wearing a tie.  On \\nthe\\noutside he had been a vice-president in the trust department of a large Portland\\nbank.  Good work for a man as young as he was, especially when you consider how\\nconservative most banks are . . . and you have to multiply that conservatism by\\n\\nten when you get up into New England, where folks dont like to trust a man with\\ntheir money unless hes bald, limping, and constantly plucking at his pants to\\n\\nget his truss around straight.  Andy was in for murdering his wife and her \\nlover.\\n\\nAs I believe I have said, everyone in prison is an innocent man.  Oh, they read\\nthat scripture the way those holy rollers on TV read the Book of Revelation.\\nThey were the victims of judges with hearts of stone and balls to match, or\\nincompetent lawyers, or police frame-ups, or bad luck.  They read the scripture,\\nbut      you can see a different scripture in their faces.  Most cons are a low \\nsort,\\n\\nno good to themselves or anyone else, and their worst luck was that their\\nmothers carried them to term.\\n\\nIn all my years at Shawshank, there have been less than ten men whom I believed\\nwhen they told me they were innocent.  Andy Dufresne was one of them, although I\\nonly became convinced of his innocence over a period of years.  If I had been on\\nthe jury that heard his case in Portland Superior Court over six stormy weeks in\\n1947-48, I would have voted to convict, too.\\n\\nIt was one hell of a case, all right; one of those juicy ones with all the right\\nelements.  There was a beautiful girl with society connections (dead), a local\\nsports   figure (also dead), and a prominent young businessman in the dock.  \\nThere\\nwas this, plus all the scandal the newspapers could hint at.  The prosecution \\nhad\\nan open-and-shut case.  The trial only lasted as long as it did because the DA\\n\\nwas planning to run for the U.S. House of Representatives and he wanted John Q.\\nPublic to get a good long look at his resume.  It was a crackerjack legal \\ncircus,\\nwith spectators getting in line at four in the morning, despite the subzero\\ntemperatures, to assure themselves of a seat.\\n\\nThe facts of the prosecutions case that Andy never contested were these: that\\nhe had a wife, Linda Collins Dufresne; that in June of 1947 she had expressed an\\ninterest in learning the game of golf at the Falmouth Hills Country Club; that\\n\\nshe did indeed take lessons for four months; that her instructor was the\\n\\nFalmouth Hills golf pro, Glenn Quentin; that in late August of 1947 Andy learned\\nthat Quentin and his wife had become lovers; that Andy and Linda Dufresne argued\\nbitterly on the afternoon of September 10th, 1947. that the subject of their\\n\\n\\nargument was her infidelity.\\n\\nHe testified that Linda professed to be glad he knew; the sneaking around, she\\nsaid, was distressing. She told Andy that she planned to obtain a Reno divorce.\\nAndy told her he would see her in hell before he would see her in Reno. She went\\noff to spend the night with Quentin in Quentins rented bungalow not far from\\n\\nthe golf course. The next morning his cleaning woman found both of them dead in\\nbed. Each had been shot four times.\\n\\nIt was that last fact that militated more against Andy than any of the others.\\n\\nThe DA with the political aspirations made a great deal of it in his opening\\nstatement and his closing summation. Andrew Dufresne, he said, was not a wronged\\nhusband seeking a hot-blooded revenge against his cheating wife; that, the DA\\n\\nsaid, could be understood, if not condoned. But this revenge had been of a much\\ncolder type. Consider! the DA thundered at the jury. Four and four! Not six\\nshots, but eight! He had fired the gun empty . . . and then stopped to reload \\nso\\n\\nhe could shoot each of them again! FOUR FOR HIM AND FOUR FOR HER, the\\nPortland Sun blared. The Boston Register dubbed him the “Even-Steven Killer.”\\n\\nA clerk from the Wise Pawnshop in Lewiston testified that he had sold a \\nsix-shot\\n\\n.38 Police Special to Andrew Dufresne just two days before the double murder. A\\nbartender from the country club bar testified that Andy had come in around seven\\noclock on the evening of September 10th, had tossed off three straight whiskeys\\nin a twenty-minute period-when he got up from the bar-stool he told the\\nbartender that he was going up to Glenn Quentins house and he, the bartender,\\ncould \"read about the rest of it in the papers.\" Another clerk, this one from\\n\\nthe Handy-Pik store a mile or so from Quentins house, told the court that\\nDufresne had come in around quarter to nine on that same night. He purchased\\ncigarettes, three quarts of beer, and some dishtowels. The county medical\\nexaminer testified that Quentin and the Dufresne woman had been killed between\\n11:00 P.M. and 2:00 A.M. on the night of September 10th- 11th. The detective\\nfrom the Attorney Generals office who had been in charge of the case testified\\nthat there was a turnout less than seventy yards from the bungalow, and that on\\nthe afternoon of September 11th, three pieces of evidence had been removed from\\nthat turnout: first item, two empty quart bottles of Narragansett Beer (with the\\ndefendants fingerprints on them); second item, twelve cigarette ends (all\\n\\nKools, the defendants brand); third item, a plaster cast of a set of tire\\ntracks (exactly matching the tread-and-wear pattern of the tires on the\\ndefendants 1947 Plymouth).\\n\\nIn the living room of Quentins bungalow, four dishtowels had been found lying\\n\\non the sofa. There were bullet-holes through them and powder-burns on them. The\\ndetective theorized (over the agonized objections of Andys lawyer) that the\\nmurderer       had wrapped the towels around the muzzle of the murder-weapon to \\nmuffle\\nthe sound of the gunshots.\\n\\n\\nAndy Dufresne took the stand in his own defense and told his story calmly,\\ncoolly, and dispassionately. He said he had begun to hear distressing rumors\\nabout his wife and Glenn Quentin as early as the last week in July. In late\\n\\nAugust he had become distressed enough to investigate a bit. On an evening when\\nLinda was supposed to have gone shopping in Portland after her golf lesson, Andy\\nhad followed her and Quentin to Quentins two-story rented house (inevitably\\ndubbed \"the love-nest\" by the papers). He had parked in the turnout until\\n\\nQuentin drove her back to the country club where her car was parked, about three\\nhours later.\\n\\n\"Do you mean to tell this court that you followed your wife in your brand-new\\nPlymouth sedan?\" the DA asked him on cross examination.\\n\\n\"I swapped cars for the evening with a friend,\" Andy said, and this cool\\nadmission of how well-planned his investigation had been did him no good at all\\nin      the eyes of the jury.\\n\\nAfter returning the friends car and picking up his own, he had gone home. Linda\\nhad been in bed, reading a book. He asked her how her trip to Portland had been.\\nShe replied that it had been fun, but she hadnt seen anything she liked well\\nenough to buy. \"Thats when I knew for sure,\" Andy told the breathless\\nspectators.    He spoke in the same calm, remote voice in which he delivered \\nalmost\\nall         of his testimony.\\n\\n\"What was your frame of mind in the seventeen days between then and the night\\nyour wife was murdered?\" Andys lawyer asked him.\\n\\n\"I was in great distress,\" Andy said calmly, coldly. Like a man reciting a\\nshopping list he said that he had considered suicide, and had even gone so far\\nas      to purchase a gun in Lewiston on September 8th.\\n\\nHis lawyer then invited him to tell the jury what had happened after his wife\\n\\nleft to meet Glenn Quentin on the night of the murders. Andy told them . . . and\\nthe impression he made was the worst possible.\\n\\nI knew him for close to thirty years, and I can tell you he was the most\\n\\nself-possessed man Ive ever known. What was right with him hed only give you a\\nlittle at a time. What was wrong with him he kept bottled up inside. If he ever\\n\\nhad a dark night of the soul, as some writer or other has called it, you would\\nnever know. He was the type of man who, if he had decided to commit suicide,\\nwould do it without leaving a note but not until his affairs had been put neatly\\nin order. If he had cried on the witness stand, or if his voice had thickened\\n\\nand grown hesitant, even if he had started yelling at that Washington-bound\\nDistrict Attorney, I dont believe he would have gotten the life sentence he\\n\\n\\nwound up with. Even if he hadve, he would have been out on parole by 1954. But\\nhe told his story like a recording machine, seeming to say to the jury: This is\\n\\nit. Take it or leave it. They left it.\\n\\nHe said he was drunk that night, that hed been more or less drunk since August\\n24th, and that he was a man who didnt handle his liquor very well. Of course\\nthat by itself would have been hard for any jury to swallow. They just couldnt\\nsee this coldly self-possessed young man in the neat double-breasted three-piece\\nwoolen suit ever getting falling-down drunk over his wifes sleazy little affair\\nwith some small-town golf pro. I believed it because I had a chance to watch\\nAndy that those six men and six women didnt have.\\n\\nAndy Dufresne took just four drinks a year all the time I knew him. He would\\nmeet me in the exercise yard every year about a week before his birthday and\\n\\nthen again about two weeks before Christmas. On each occasion he would arrange\\nfor a bottle of Jack Daniels. He bought it the way most cons arrange to buy\\n\\ntheir stuff-the slaves wages they pay in here, plus a little of his own. Up\\n\\nuntil 1965 what you got for your time was a dime an hour. In 65 they raised it\\nall the way up to a quarter. My commission on liquor was and is ten per cent,\\nand when you add on that surcharge to the price of a fine sippin whiskey like\\nthe Black Jack, you get an idea of how many hours of Andy Dufresnes sweat in\\nthe prison laundry was going to buy his four drinks a year.\\n\\nOn the morning of his birthday, September 20th, he would have himself a big\\nknock, and then hed have another that night after lights-out. The following day\\nhed give the rest of the bottle back to me, and I would share it around. As for\\nthe other bottle, he dealt himself one drink Christmas night and another on New\\nYears Eve. Then that bottle would also come to me with instructions to pass it\\non. Four drinks a year-and that is the behavior of a man who has been bitten\\nhard by the bottle. Hard enough to draw blood.\\n\\nHe told the jury that on the night of the tenth he had been so drunk he could\\n\\nonly remember what had happened in little isolated snatches. He had gotten drunk\\nthat afternoon-\"I took on a double helping of Dutch courage\" is how he put\\n\\nit-before taking on Linda.\\n\\nAfter she left to meet Quentin, he remembered deciding to confront them. On the\\nway to Quentins bungalow, he swung into the country club for a couple of quick\\nones. He could not, he said, remember telling the bartender he could \"read about\\nthe rest of it in the papers,\" or saying anything to him at all. He remembered\\nbuying beer in the Handy-Pik, but not the dishtowels. \"Why would I want\\ndishtowels?\" he asked, and one of the papers reported that three of the lady\\njurors shuddered.\\n\\nLater, much later, he speculated to me about the clerk who had testified on the\\n\\n\\nsubject of those dishtowels, and I think its worth jotting down what he said.\\n\"Suppose that, during their canvass for witnesses,\" Andy said one day in the\\nexercise yard, \"they stumble on this fellow who sold me the beer that night. By\\nthen three days have gone by. The facts of the case have been broadsided in all\\nthe papers. Maybe they ganged up on the guy, five or six cops, plus the dick\\nfrom the Attorney Generals office, plus the DAs assistant. Memory is a pretty\\nsubjective thing, Red. They could have started out with Isnt it possible that\\n\\nhe purchased four or five dishtowels? and worked their way up from there. If\\nenough people want you to remember something, that can be a pretty powerful\\npersuader.\"\\n\\nI agreed that it could.\\n\\n\"But theres one even more powerful,\" Andy went on in that musing way of his. \"I\\nthink its at least possible that he convinced himself. It was the limelight.\\n\\nReporters asking him questions, his picture in the papers . . . all topped, of\\ncourse, by his star turn in court. Im not saying that he deliberately falsified\\nhis story, or perjured himself. I think its possible that he could have passed\\na lie detector test with flying colors, or sworn on his mothers sacred name\\nthat I bought those dishtowels. But still . . . memory is such a goddam\\nsubjective thing.\\n\\n\"I know this much: even though my own lawyer thought I had to be lying about\\nhalf my story, he never bought that business about the dishtowels. Its crazy on\\nthe face of it. I was pig-drunk, too drunk to have been thinking about muffling\\nthe gunshots. If Id done it, I just would have let them rip.\"\\n\\nHe went up to the turnout and parked there. He drank beer and smoked cigarettes.\\nHe watched the lights downstairs in Quentins place go out. He watched a single\\nlight go on upstairs . . . and fifteen minutes later he watched that one go \\nout.\\n\\nHe said he could guess the rest.\\n\\n\"Mr. Dufresne, did you then go up to Glenn Quentins house and kill the two of\\nthem?\" his lawyer thundered.\\n\\n\"No, I did not,\" Andy answered. By midnight, he said, he was sobering up. He was\\nalso feeling the first signs of a bad hangover. He decided to go home and sleep\\n\\nit off and think about the whole thing in a more adult fashion the next day. \"At\\nthat time, as I drove home, I was beginning to think that the wisest course\\nwould be to simply let her go to Reno and get her divorce.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, Mr. Dufresne.\"\\nThe DA popped up.\\n\\n\\n\"You divorced her in the quickest way you could think of, didnt you? You\\ndivorced her with a .38 revolver wrapped in dishtowels, didnt you?\"\\n\\n\"No sir, I did not,\" Andy said calmly.\\n\"And then you shot her lover.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir.\"\\n\\n\"You mean you shot Quentin first?\"\\n\\n\"I mean I didnt shoot either one of them. I drank two quarts of beer and smoked\\nhowever many cigarettes the police found at the turnout. Then I drove home and\\nwent to bed.\"\\n\\n\"You told the jury that between August twenty-fourth and September tenth you\\nwere feeling suicidal.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Suicidal enough to buy a revolver.\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Would it bother you overmuch, Mr. Dufresne, if I told you that you do not seem\\nto me to be the suicidal type?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" Andy said, \"but you dont impress me as being terribly sensitive, and I\\ndoubt very much that, if I were feeling suicidal, I would take my problem to\\nyou.\"\\n\\nThere was a slight tense titter in the courtroom at this, but it won him no\\npoints with the jury.\\n\\n\"Did you take your thirty-eight with you on the night of September tenth?\"\\n\"No; as Ive already testified-\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!\" The DA smiled sarcastically. \"You threw it into the river, didnt\\nyou? The Royal River. On the afternoon of September ninth . \"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"One day before the murders.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Thats convenient, isnt it?\"\\n\\n\"Its neither convenient nor inconvenient. Only the truth.\"\\n\\n\"I believe you heard Lieutenant Minchers testimony?\" Mincher had been in charge\\nof the party which had dragged the stretch of the Royal near Pond Road Bridge,\\nfrom which Andy had testified he had thrown the gun. The police had not found\\nit.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir. You know I heard it.\"\\n\\n\"Then you heard him tell the court that they found no gun, although they dragged\\nfor three days. That was rather convenient, too, wasnt it?\"\\n\\n\"Convenience aside, its a fact that they didnt find the gun,\" Andy responded\\ncalmly. \"But I should like to point out to both you and the jury that the Pond\\nRoad Bridge is very close to where the Royal River empties into the Bay of\\nYarmouth. The current is strong. The gun may have been carried out into the bay\\nitself.\"\\n\\n\"And so no comparison can be made between the riflings on the bullets taken from\\nthe bloodstained corpses of your wife and Mr. Glenn Quentin and the riflings on\\nthe barrel of your gun. Thats correct, isnt it, Mr. Dufresne?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. \"\\n\\n\"Thats also rather convenient, isnt it?\"\\n\\nAt that, according to the papers, Andy displayed one of the few slight emotional\\nreactions he allowed himself during the entire six-week period of the trial. A\\nslight, bitter smile crossed his face.\\n\\n\"Since I am innocent of this crime, sir, and since I am telling the truth about\\nthrowing my gun into the river the day before the crime took place, then it\\nseems to me decidedly inconvenient that the gun was never found.\"\\n\\nThe DA hammered at him for two days. He re-read the Handy-Pik clerks testimony\\nabout the dishtowels to Andy. Andy repeated that he could not recall buying\\n\\nthem, but admitted that he also couldnt remember not buying them.\\n\\nWas it true that Andy and Linda Dufresne had taken out a joint insurance policy\\nin early 1947 ? Yes, that was true. And if acquitted, wasnt it true that Andy\\nstood to gain fifty thousand dollars in benefits? True. And wasnt it true that\\n\\n\\nhe had gone up to Glenn Quentins house with murder in his heart, and wasnt it\\nalso true that he had indeed committed murder twice over? No, it was not true.\\nThen what did he think had happened, since there had been no signs of robbery?\\n\\n\"I have no way of knowing that, sir,\" Andy said quietly.\\n\\nThe case went to the jury at 1:00 P.M. on a snowy Wednesday afternoon. The\\ntwelve jurymen and -women came back in at 3:30. The bailiff said they would have\\nbeen back earlier, but they had held off in order to enjoy a nice chicken dinner\\nfrom Bentleys Restaurant at the countys expense. They found him guilty, and\\nbrother, if Maine had the death-penalty, he would have done the air dance before\\nthat springs crocuses poked their heads out of the snow.\\n\\nThe DA had asked him what he thought had happened, and Andy slipped the\\nquestion-but he did have an idea, and I got it out of him late one evening in\\n1955. It had taken those seven years for us to progress from nodding\\nacquaintances to fairly close friends- but I never felt really close to Andy\\n\\nuntil 1960 or so, and I believe I was the only one who ever did get really close\\nto him. Both being long-timers, we were in the same cellblock from beginning to\\nend, although I was halfway down the corridor from him.\\n\\n\"What do I think?\" He laughed-but there was no humor in the sound. \"I think\\nthere was a lot of bad luck floating around that night. More than could ever get\\ntogether in the same short span of time again. I think it must have been some\\nstranger, just passing through. Maybe someone who had a flat tire on that road\\nafter     I went home. Maybe a burglar. Maybe a psychopath. He killed them, \\nthats\\nall. And Im here.\"\\n\\nIII\\n\\n\\nAs simple as that. And he was condemned to spend the rest of his life in\\nShawshank - or the part of it that mattered. Five years later he began to have\\nparole hearings, and he was turned down just as regular as clockwork in spite of\\nbeing a model prisoner. Getting a pass out of Shawshank when youve got murder\\nstamped on your admittance-slip is slow work, as slow as a river eroding a rock.\\nSeven men sit on the board, two more than at most state prisons, and every one\\nof those seven has an ass as hard as the water drawn up from a mineral-spring\\nwell. You cant buy those guys, you cant sweet-talk them, you cant cry for\\n\\nthem. As far as the board in here is concerned, money dont talk, and nobody\\nwalks. There were other reasons in Andys case as well . . . but that belongs a\\nlittle further along in my story.\\n\\nThere was a trusty, name of Kendricks, who was into me for some pretty heavy\\nmoney back in the fifties, and it was four years before he got it all paid off.\\n\\nMost of the interest he paid me was information-in my line of work, youre dead\\nif you cant find ways of keeping your ear to the ground. This Kendricks, for\\ninstance, had access to records I was never going to see running a stamper down\\nin    the goddam plate-shop.\\n\\nKendricks told me that the parole board vote was 7-0 against Andy Dufresne\\nthrough 1957, 6-1 in 58, 7-0 again in 59, and 5-2 in 60. After that I dont\\nknow, but I do know that sixteen years later he was still in Cell 14 of\\n\\nCellblock 5. By then – 1975 - he was fifty-seven. They probably would have \\ngotten\\nbig-hearted and let him out around 1983. They give you life, and thats what\\n\\nthey take-all of it that counts, anyway. Maybe they set you loose someday, but \\n.\\n\\n. . ..\\n\\nWell, listen: I knew this guy, Sherwood Bolton, his name was, and he had\\nthis pigeon in his cell. From 1945 until 1953, when they let him out, he had\\nthat pigeon. He wasnt any Birdman of Alcatraz; he just had this pigeon. Jake,\\n\\nhe called him. He set Jake free a day before he, Sherwood, that is, was to walk,\\nand Jake flew away just as pretty as you could want. But about a week after\\nSherwood Bolton left our happy little family, a friend of mine called me over to\\nthe  west corner of the exercise yard, where Sherwood used to hang out. A bird\\nwas lying there like a very small pile of dirty bed-linen. It looked starved. My\\nfriend said: \"Isnt that Jake, Red?\" It was. That pigeon was just as dead as a\\nturd.\\n\\nI remember the first time Andy Dufresne got in touch with me for something; I\\nremember like it was yesterday. That wasnt the time he wanted Rita Hayworth,\\nthough. That came later. In that summer of 1948 he came around for something\\nelse.\\n\\nMost of my deals are done right there in the exercise yard, and thats where\\n\\n\\nthis one went down. Our yard is big, much bigger than most Its a perfect\\nsquare, ninety yards on a side. The north side is the outer wall, with a\\n\\nguard-tower at either end. The guards up there are armed with binoculars and\\nriot guns. The main gate is in that north side. The truck loading-bays are on\\nthe south side of the yard. There are five of them. Shawshank is a busy place\\nduring the work week-deliveries in, deliveries out. We have the license-plate\\nfactory, and a big industrial laundry that does all the prison wet-wash, plus \\nthat\\nof Kittery Receiving Hospital and the Eliot Nursing Home. Theres also a big\\nautomotive garage where mechanic inmates fix prison, state, and municipal\\n\\nvehicles-not to mention the private cars of the screws, the administration \\nofficers . . .\\nand, on more than one occasion, those of the parole board.\\n\\nThe east side is a thick stone wall full of tiny slit windows. Cellblock 5 is on\\nthe other side of that wall. The west side is Administration and the infirmary.\\n\\nShawshank has never been as overcrowded as most prisons, and back in 48 it was\\nonly filled to something like two-thirds capacity, but at any given time there\\n\\nmight be eighty to a hundred and twenty cons on the yard- playing toss with a\\nfootball or a baseball, shooting craps, jawing at each other, making deals. On\\nSunday    the place was even more crowded; on Sunday the place would have looked\\nlike  a country holiday . . . if there had been any women.\\n\\nIt was on a Sunday that Andy first came to me. I had just finished talking to\\n\\nElmore Armitage, a fellow who often came in handy to me, about a radio when Andy\\nwalked up. I knew who he was, of course; he had a reputation for being a snob\\n\\nand a cold fish. People were saying he was marked for trouble already. One of\\n\\nthe people saying so was Bogs Diamond, a bad man to have on your case. Andy had\\nno cellmate, and Id heard that was just the way he wanted it, although people\\n\\nwere already saying he thought his shit smelled sweeter than the ordinary. But I\\ndont have to listen to rumors about a man when I can judge him for myself.\\n\"Hello,\" he said. \"Im Andy Dufresne.\" He offered his hand and I shook it. He\\nwasnt a man to waste time being social; he got right to the point. \"I\\n\\nunderstand that youre a man who knows how to get things . \"\\n\\nI agreed that I was able to locate certain items from time to time.\\n\"How do you do that?\" Andy asked.\\n\\n\"Sometimes,\" I said, \"things just seem to come into my hand. I cant explain it.\\nUnless its because Im Irish.\"\\n\\nHe smiled a little at that. \"I wonder if you could get me a rock hammer. \"\\n\"What would that be, and why would you want it?\"\\n\\nAndy looked surprised. \"Do you make motivations a part of your business?\" With\\n\\n\\nwords like those I could understand how he had gotten a reputation for being the\\nsnobby sort, the kind of guy who likes to put on airs-but I sensed a tiny \\nthread\\n\\nof humor in his question.\\n\\n\"Ill tell you,\" I said. \"If you wanted a toothbrush, I wouldnt ask questions.\\n\\nId just quote you a price. Because a toothbrush, you see, is a non-lethal sort\\nof an object.\"\\n\\n\"You have strong feelings about lethal objects?\"\\n\"I do.\"\\n\\nAn old friction-taped baseball flew toward us and he turned, cat-quick, and\\npicked it out of the air. It was a move Frank Malzone would have been proud of.\\n\\nAndy flicked the ball back to where it had come from-just a quick and\\n\\neasy-looking flick of the wrist, but that throw had some mustard on it, just the\\nsame. I could see a lot of people were watching us with one eye as they went\\nabout their business. Probably the guards in the tower were watching, too. I\\nwont gild the lily; there are cons that swing weight in any prison, maybe four\\nor five in a small one, maybe two or three dozen in a big one. At Shawshank I\\n\\nwas one of those with some weight, and what I thought of Andy Dufresne would\\nhave a lot to do with how his time went. He probably knew it, too, but he wasnt\\nkowtowing or sucking up to me, and I respected him for that.\\n\\n\"Fair enough. Ill tell you what it is and why I want it. A rock hammer looks\\nlike a miniature pickaxe-about so long.\" He held his hands about a foot apart,\\nand that was when I first noticed how neatly kept his nails were. \"Its got a\\nsmall sharp pick on one end and a flat, blunt hammerhead on the other. I want it\\nbecause I like rocks.\"\\n\\n\"Rocks, \" I said.\\n\\n\"Squat down here a minute,\" he said.\\n\\nI humored him. We hunkered down on our haunches like Indians.\\n\\nAndy took a handful of exercise yard dirt and began to sift it between his neat\\nhands, so it emerged in a fine cloud. Small pebbles were left over, one or two\\nsparkly, the rest dull and plain. One of the dull ones was quartz, but it was\\nonly dull until youd rubbed it clean. Then it had a nice milky glow. Andy did\\nthe cleaning and then tossed it to me. I caught it and named it.\\n\\n\"Quartz, sure,\" he said. \"And look. Mica. Shale. Silted granite. Heres a place\\nof graded limestone, from when they cut this place out of the side of the \\nhill.\"\\n\\nHe tossed them away and dusted his hands. \"Im a rockhound. At least . . . I \\nwas\\n\\n\\na rockhound. In my old life. Id like to be one again, on a limited scale.\"\\n\\n\"Sunday expeditions in the exercise yard?\" I asked, standing up. It was a silly\\nidea, and yet . . . seeing that little piece of quartz had given my heart a\\n\\nfunny tweak. I dont know exactly why; just an association with the outside\\nworld, I suppose. You didnt think of such things in terms of the yard. Quartz\\nwas something you picked out of a small, quick-running stream.\\n\\n\"Better to have Sunday expeditions here than no Sunday expeditions at all,\" he\\nsaid.\\n\\n\"You could plant an item like that rock-hammer in somebodys skull,\" I remarked.\\n\"I have no enemies here,\" he said quietly.\\n\\n\"No?\" I smiled. \"Wait awhile.\"\\n\\n\"If theres trouble, I can handle it without using a rock hammer. \"\\n\\n\"Maybe you want to try an escape? Going under the wall? Because if you do-\"\\n\\nHe laughed politely. When I saw the rock-hammer three weeks later, I understood\\nwhy.\\n\\n\"You know,\" I said, \"if anyone sees you with it, theyll take it away. If they\\nsaw you with a spoon, theyd take it away. What are you going to do, just sit\\ndown here in the yard and start bangin away?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I believe I can do a lot better than that.\"\\n\\nI nodded. That part of it really wasnt my business, anyway. A man engages my\\nservices to get him something. Whether he can keep it or not after I get it is\\n\\nhis business.\\n\\n\"How much would an item like that go for?\" I asked. I was beginning to enjoy his\\nquiet, low-key style. When youve spent ten years in stir, as I had then, you\\n\\ncan get awfully tired of the bellowers and the braggarts and the loud-mouths.\\nYes, I think it would be fair to say I liked Andy from the first.\\n\\n\"Eight dollars in any rock-and-gem shop,\" he said, \"but I realize that in a\\nbusiness like yours you work on a cost-plus basis-\"\\n\\n\"Cost plus ten per cent is my going rate, but I have to go up some on a \\ndangerous\\nitem. For something like the gadget youre talking about, it takes a little more\\ngoose-grease to get the wheel turning. Lets say ten dollars.\\n\\n\\n\"Ten it is.\"\\n\\nI looked at him, smiling a little. \"Have you got ten dollars?\"\\n\"I do,\" he said quietly.\\n\\nA long time after, I discovered that he had better than five hundred. He had\\nbrought it in with him. When they check you at this hotel, one of the bellhops\\nis obliged to bend you over ant take a look up your works-but there are a lot of\\nworks, and, not to put too fine a point on it, a man who is really determined\\ncan get; fairly large item quite a ways up them-far enough to be out o sight,\\nunless the bellhop you happen to draw is in the mood to pull on a rubber glove\\nand go prospecting.\\n\\n\"Thats fine, \" I said. \"You ought to know what I expect if you get caught with\\nwhat I get you.\"\\n\\n\"I suppose I should,\" he said, and I could tell by the slight change in his gray\\neyes that he knew exactly what I was going to say. It was a slight lightening, a\\ngleam of his special ironic humor\\n\\n\"If you get caught, youll say you found it. Thats about the long and short of\\nit. Theyll put you in solitary for three or you weeks . . . plus, of course,\\n\\nyoull lose your toy and youll get black mark on your record. If you give them\\nmy name, you and will never do business again. Not for so much as a pair of\\nshoelace or a bag of Bugler. And Ill send some fellows around to lump you up. I\\ndont like violence, but youll understand my position. I can allow it to get\\naround that I cant handle myself. That would sure finish me.\"\\n\\n\"Yes. I suppose it would. I understand, and you dont need to worry. \"\\n\"I never worry,\" I said. \"In a place like this theres no percentage in it.\"\\n\\nHe nodded and walked away. Three days later he walked u] beside me in the\\nexercise yard during the laundrys morning break He didnt speak or even look my\\nway, but pressed a picture of the Honorable Alexander Hamilton into my hand\\n\\nas neatly as a good magician does a card-trick. He was a man who adapted fast.\\n\\nI got him his rock-hammer. I had it in my cell for one night, and it was just \\nas he described\\nit. It was no tool for escape (it would have taken a man just about six hundred \\nyears to\\ntunnel under the wall using that rock-hammer, I figured), but I still felt some \\nmisgivings. If\\nyou planted that pickaxe end in a mans head, he would surely never\\n\\nlisten to Fibber McGee and Molly on the radio again. And Andy had already begun \\nhaving\\ntrouble with the sisters. I hoped it wasnt them he was wanting the rock-\\n\\nhammer for.\\n\\n\\nIn the end, I trusted my judgment. Early the next morning, twenty minutes before\\nthe wake-up horn went off, I slipped the rock-hammer and a package of Camels to\\nErnie, the old trusty who swept the Cellblock 5 corridors until he was let free\\n\\nin 1956. He slipped it into his tunic without a word, and I didnt see the\\n\\nrock hammer again for nineteen years, and by then it was damned near worn away \\nto\\nnothing.\\n\\nThe following Sunday Andy walked over to me in the exercise yard again. He was\\nnothing to look at that day, I can tell you. His lower lip was swelled up so \\nbig\\n\\nit looked like a summer sausage, his right eye was swollen half-shut, and there\\nwas an ugly washboard scrape across one cheek. He was having his troubles with\\nthe sisters, all right, but he never mentioned them. \"Thanks for the tool,\" he\\n\\nsaid, and walked away.\\n\\nI watched him curiously. He walked a few steps, saw something in the dirt, bent\\nover, and picked it up. It was a small rock. Prison fatigues, except for those\\nworn  by mechanics when theyre on the job, have no pockets. But there are ways\\nto get around that. The little pebble disappeared up Andys sleeve and didnt\\ncome down. I admired that . . . and I admired him. In spite of the problems he\\nwas having, he was going on with his life. There are thousands who dont or\\nwont or cant, and plenty of them arent in prison, either. And I noticed that,\\nalthough his face looked as if a twister had happened to it, his hands were\\n\\nstill neat and clean, the nails well-kept.\\n\\nI didnt see much of him over the next six months; Andy spent a lot of that time\\nin solitary.\\n\\nIV\\n\\n\\nA few words about the sisters.\\n\\nIn a lot of pens they are known as bull queers or jailhouse susies-just lately\\nthe term in fashion is \"killer queens.\" But in Shawshank they were always the\\nsisters. I dont know why, but other than the name I guess there was no\\ndifference.\\n\\nIt comes as no surprise to most these days that theres a lot of buggery going\\non inside the walls-except to some of the new fish, maybe, who have the\\n\\nmisfortune to be young, slim, good-looking, and unwary-but homosexuality, like\\nstraight sex, comes in a hundred different shapes and forms. There are men who\\ncant stand to be without sex of some kind and turn to another man to keep from\\ngoing crazy. Usually what follows is an arrangement between two fundamentally\\nheterosexual men, although Ive sometimes wondered if they are quite as\\nheterosexual as they thought they were going to be when they get back to their\\nwives or their girlfriends.\\n\\nThere are also men who get \"turned\" in prison. In the current parlance they \"go\\ngay,\" or \"come out of the closet. \" Mostly (but not always) they play the\\nfemale, and their favors are competed for fiercely.\\n\\nAnd then there are the sisters.\\n\\nThey are to prison society what the rapist is to the society outside the walls.\\nTheyre usually long-timers, doing hard bullets for brutal crimes. Their prey is\\nthe young, the weak, and the inexperienced . . . or, as in the case of Andy\\n\\nDufresne, the weak-looking. Their hunting grounds are the showers, the cramped,\\ntunnel-like areaway behind the industrial washers in the laundry, sometimes the\\ninfirmary. On more than one occasion rape has occurred in the closet-sized\\nprojection booth behind the auditorium. Most often what the sisters take by\\n\\nforce they could have had for free, if they wanted it that way; those who have\\nbeen turned always seem to have \"crushes\" on one sister or another, like teenage\\ngirls with their Sinatras, Presleys, or Redfords. But for the sisters, the joy\\n\\nhas always been in taking it by force . . . and I guess it always will be.\\n\\nBecause of his small size and fair good looks (and maybe also because of that\\nvery quality of self-possession I had admired), the sisters were after Andy from\\nthe day he walked in. If this was some kind of fairy story, Id tell you that\\nAndy fought the good fight until they left him alone. I wish I could say that,\\nbut     I cant. Prison is no fairy-tale world.\\n\\nThe first time for him was in the shower less than three days after he joined\\nour happy Shawshank family. Just a lot of slap and tickle that time, I\\nunderstand. They like to size you up before they make their real move, like\\n\\n\\njackals finding out if the prey is as weak and hamstrung as it looks.\\n\\nAndy punched back and bloodied the lip of a big, hulking sister named Bogs\\nDiamond-gone these many years since to who knows where. A guard broke it up\\nbefore it could go any further, but Bogs promised to get him-and Bogs did.\\n\\nThe second time was behind the washers in the laundry. A lot has gone on in that\\nlong, dusty, and narrow space over the years; the guards know about it and just\\nlet it be. Its dim and littered with bags of washing and bleaching compound,\\ndrums of Hexlite catalyst, as harmless as salt if your hands are dry, murderous\\n\\nas battery acid if theyre wet. The guards dont like to go back there. Theres\\n\\nno room to maneuver, and one of the first things they teach them when they come\\nto work in a place like this is to never let the cons get you in a place where\\n\\nyou cant back up.\\n\\nBogs wasnt there that day, but Henley Backus, who had been washroom foreman\\ndown there since 1922, told me that four of his friends were. Andy held them at\\n\\nbay for awhile with a scoop of burning Hexlite, threatening to throw it in \\ntheir eyes if\\nthey came any closer, but he tripped trying to back around one of the big Washex\\nfourpockets. That was all it took. They were on him.\\n\\nI guess the phrase gang-rape is one that doesnt change much from one generation\\nto the next. Thats what they did to him, those four sisters. They bent him \\nover\\n\\na gear-box and one of them held a Phillips screwdriver to his temple while they\\ngave him the business. It rips you up some, but not bad-am I speaking from\\npersonal experience, you ask?-I only wish I werent. You bleed for awhile. If\\n\\nyou dont want some clown asking you if you just started your period, you wad up\\na bunch of toilet paper and keep it down the back of your underwear until it\\n\\nstops. The bleeding really is like a menstrual flow; it keeps up for two, maybe\\nthree days, a slow trickle. Then it stops. No harm done, unless theyve done\\nsomething even more unnatural to you. No physical harm done but rape is rape,\\nand eventually you have to look at your face in the mirror again and decide what\\nto make of yourself.\\n\\nAndy went through that alone, the way he went through everything alone in those\\ndays. He must have come to the conclusion that others before him had come to,\\nnamely, that then are only two ways to deal with the sisters: fight them and get\\ntaken   or just get taken.\\n\\nHe decided to fight. When Bogs and two of his buddies cam after him a week or so\\nafter the laundry incident (\"I heard ya go broke in,\" Bogs said, according to\\n\\nErnie, who was around at the time), Andy slugged it out with them. He broke the\\nnose of fellow named Rooster MacBride, a heavy-gutted farmer who was is for\\nbeating his stepdaughter to death. Rooster died in here, Im happy to add.\\n\\nThey took him, all three of them. When it was done, Rooster and the other \\negg-it\\n\\n\\nmight have been Pete Verness, but Im no completely sure-forced Andy down to his\\nknees. Bogs Diamond stepped in front of him. He had a pearl-handled razor in\\nthose day with the words Diamond Pearl engraved on both sides of the grip He\\nopened it and said, \"Im gonna open my fly now, mister man and youre going to\\nswallow what I give you to swallow. And when you done swallowed mine, youre\\ngonna swallow Roosters. I guess you done broke his nose and I think he ought to\\nhave something to pay for it.\"\\n\\nAndy said, \"Anything of yours that you stick in my mouth youre going to lose\\nit.\"\\n\\nBogs looked at Andy like he was crazy, Ernie said.\\n\\n\"No,\" he told Andy, talking to him slowly, like Andy was stupid kid. \"You didnt\\nunderstand what I said. You do anything like that and Ill put all eight inches\\n\\nof this steel into your ear. Get it?\"\\n\\n\"I understood what you said. I dont think you understood me. Im going to bite\\nwhatever you stick into my mouth. You can put that razor into my brain, I guess,\\nbut you should know that sudden serious brain injury causes the victim to\\nsimultaneously urinate, defecate . . . and bite down.\"\\n\\nHe looked up at Bogs, smiling that little smile of his, old Ernie said, as if\\nthe three of them had been discussing stocks and bonds with him instead of\\n\\nthrowing it to him just as hard as they could. Just as if he was wearing one of\\nhis three-piece bankers suits instead of kneeling on a dirty broom-closet floor\\nwith his pants around his ankles and blood trickling down the insides of his\\nthighs.\\n\\n\"In fact,\" he went on, \"I understand that the bite-reflex is sometimes so strong\\nthat the victims jaws have to be pried open with a crowbar or a jackhandle.\"\\nBogs didnt put anything in Andys mouth that night in late February of 1948,\\nand neither did Rooster MacBride, and so far as I know, no one else ever did,\\neither. What the three of them did was to beat Andy within an inch of his life,\\nand all four of them ended up doing a jolt in solitary. Andy and Rooster\\nMacBride went by way of the infirmary.\\n\\nHow many times did that particular crew have at him? I dont know. I think\\nRooster lost his taste fairly early on -- being in nosesplints for a month can \\ndo\\nthat to a fellow -- and Bogs Diamond left off that summer, all at once.\\n\\nThat was a strange thing. Bogs was found in his cell, badly beaten, one morning\\nin early June, when he didnt show up in the breakfast nose-count. He wouldnt\\nsay who had done it, or how they had gotten to him, but being in my business, I\\nknow that a screw can be bribed to do almost anything except get a gun for an\\n\\n\\ninmate. They didnt make big salaries then, and they dont now. And in those\\ndays there was no electronic locking system, no closed-circuit TV, no\\n\\nmaster-switches which controlled whole areas of the prison. Back in 1948, each\\ncellblock had its own turnkey. A guard could have been bribed real easy to let\\nsomeone-maybe two or three someones-into the block, and, yes, even into\\nDiamonds cell.\\n\\nOf course a job like that would have cost a lot of money. Not by outside\\nstandards, no. Prison economics are on a smaller scale. When youve been in here\\nawhile, a dollar bill in your hand looks like a twenty did outside. My guess is\\nthat,       if Bogs was done, it cost someone a serious piece of change-fifteen \\nbucks,\\nwell say, for the turnkey, and two or three apiece for each of the lump-up\\n\\nguys.\\n\\nIm not saying it was Andy Dufresne, but I do know that he brought in five\\nhundred dollars when he came, and he was a banker in the straight world-a man\\nwho understands better than the rest of us the ways in which money can become\\npower.\\n\\nAnd I know this: after the beating-the three broken ribs, the hemorrhaged eye,\\nthe sprained back, and the dislocated hip-Bogs Diamond left Andy alone. In fact,\\nafter that he left everyone pretty much alone. He got to be like a high wind in\\nthe summertime, all bluster and no bite. You could say, in fact, that he turned\\ninto a \"weak sister.\"\\n\\nThat was the end of Bogs Diamond, a man who might eventually have killed Andy if\\nAndy hadnt taken steps to prevent it (if it was him who took the steps). But it\\nwasnt the end of Andys trouble with the sisters. There was a little hiatus,\\n\\nand then it began again, although not so hard or so often. Jackals like easy\\nprey, and there were easier pickings around than Andy Dufresne.\\n\\nHe always fought them, thats what I remember. He knew, I guess, that if you let\\nthem have at you even once without fighting, it got that much easier to let them\\nhave their way without fighting next time. So Andy would turn up with bruises on\\nhis face every once in awhile, and there was the matter of the two broken\\n\\nfingers six or eight months after Diamonds beating. Oh yes-and sometime in late\\n1949, the man landed in the infirmary with a broken cheekbone that was probably\\nthe result of someone swinging a nice chunk of pipe with the business-end\\nwrapped in flannel. He always fought back, and as a result, he did his time in\\nsolitary. But I dont think solitary was the hardship for Andy that it was for\\n\\nsome men. He got along with himself.\\n\\nThe sisters was something he adjusted himself to-and then, in 1950, it stopped\\nalmost completely. That is a part of my story that Ill get to in due time.\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\nIn the fall of 1948, Andy met me one morning in the exercise yard and asked me\\nif I could get him half a dozen rock-blankets.\\n\\n\"What the hell are those?\" I asked.\\n\\nHe told me that was just what rockhounds called them; they were polishing cloths\\nabout the size of dishtowels. They were heavily padded, with a smooth side and a\\nrough side-the smooth side like fine-grained sandpaper, the rough side almost as\\nabrasive as industrial steel wool (Andy also kept a box of that in his cell,\\n\\nalthough he didnt get it from me-I imagine he kited it from the prison\\nlaundry).\\n\\nI told him I thought we could do business on those, and I ended up getting them\\nfrom the very same rock-and-gem shop where Id arranged to get the rock-hammer.\\n\\nThis time I charged Andy my usual ten per cent and not a penny more. I didnt\\nsee anything lethal or even dangerous in a dozen 7\" x 7\" squares of padded\\ncloth. Rock-blankets, indeed.\\n\\nIt was about five months later that Andy asked if I could get him Rita Hayworth.\\nThat conversation took place in the auditorium, during a movie-show. Nowadays we\\nget the movie-shows once or twice a week, but back then the shows were a monthly\\nevent. Usually the movies we got had a morally uplifting message to them, and\\n\\nthis one, The Lost Weekend, was no different. The moral was that its dangerous\\nto drink. It was a moral we could take some comfort in.\\n\\nAndy maneuvered to get next to me, and about halfway through the show he leaned\\na little closer and asked if I could get him Rita Hayworth. Ill tell you the\\n\\ntruth, it kind of tickled me. He was usually cool, calm, and collected, but that\\nnight he was jumpy as hell, almost embarrassed, as if he was asking me to get\\nhim  a load of Trojans or one of those sheepskin-lined gadgets that are supposed\\nto \"enhance your solitary pleasure,\" as the magazines put it. He seemed\\novercharged, a man on the verge of blowing his radiator.\\n\\n\"I can get her,\" I said. \"No sweat, calm down. You want the big one or the\\nlittle one?\" At that time Rita was my best girl (a few years before it had been\\nBetty Grable) and she came in two sizes. For a buck you could get the little\\nRita. For two-fifty you could have the big Rita, four feet high and all woman.\\n\"The big one,\" he said, not looking at me. I tell you, he was a hot sketch that\\n\\n\\nnight. He was blushing just like a kid trying to get into a kootch show with his\\nbig brothers draft-card. \"Can you do it?\"\\n\\n\"Take it easy, sure I can. Does a bear shit in the woods?\" The audience was\\napplauding and catcalling as the bugs came out of the walls to get Ray Milland,\\nwho was having a bad case of the DTs\\n\\n\"How soon?\"\\n\\n\"A week. Maybe less.\"\\n\\n\"Okay. \" But he sounded disappointed, as if he had been hoping had one stuffed\\ndown my pants right then. \"How much?\"\\n\\nI quoted him the wholesale price. I could afford to give him this one at cost;\\nhed been a good customer, what with his rock-hammer and his rock-blankets.\\n\\nFurthermore, hed been a good boy-o more than one night when he was having his\\nproblems with Bogs Rooster, and the rest, I wondered how long it would be before\\nh used the rock-hammer to crack someones head open.\\n\\nPosters are a big part of my business, just behind the booze an, cigarettes,\\nusually half a step ahead of the reefer. In the sixties the business exploded in\\nevery direction, with a lot of people wanting funky hang-ups like Jimi Hendrix,\\nBob Dylan, that Easy Rider poster. But mostly its girls; one pin-up queen after\\nanother.\\n\\nA few days after Andy spoke to me, a laundry driver I did business with back\\nthen brought in better than sixty posters, most of them Rita Hayworths. You may\\neven remember the picture; sure do. Rita is dressed-sort of-in a bathing suit,\\n\\none hand behind her head, her eyes half-closed, those full, sulky red lips\\nparted. They called it Rita Hayworth, but they might as well have called it\\nWoman in Heat.\\n\\nThe prison administration knows about the black market, in case you were\\nwondering. Sure they do. They probably know almost much about my business as I\\ndo myself. They live with it because they know that a prison is like a big\\n\\npressure-cooker, and there has to be vents somewhere to let off steam. They make\\nthe occasion; bust, and Ive done time in solitary a time or three over the \\nyear\\n\\nbut when its something like posters, they wink. Live and let live And when a\\nbig Rita Hayworth went up in some fishies cell, the assumption was that it came\\nin the mail from a friend or a relative. Of course all the care-packages from\\n\\nfriends and relatives are opened and the contents inventoried, but who goes back\\nand rechecks the inventory sheets for something as harmless as a Rita Hayworth\\nor Ava Gardner pin-up? When youre in a pressure cooker you learn to live and \\nlet\\nlive or somebody will carve you a brand-new mouth just above the Adams apple.\\n\\n\\nYou learn to make allowances.\\n\\nIt was Ernie again who took the poster up to Andys cell, 14, from my own, 6.\\nAnd it was Ernie who brought back the note, written in Andys careful hand, just\\none word: \"Thanks.\"\\n\\nA little while later, as they filed us out for morning chow, I glanced into his\\n\\ncell and saw Rita over his bunk in all her swimsuited glory, one hand behind her\\nhead, her eyes half-closed, those soft, satiny lips parted. It was over his bunk\\nwhere he could look at her nights, after lights-out, in the glow of the arc\\nsodium lights in the exercise yard.\\n\\nBut in the bright morning sunlight, there were dark slashes across her face-the\\nshadow of the bars on his single slit window.\\n\\n\\nVI\\n\\nNow Im going to tell you what happened in mid-May of 1950 that finally ended\\nAndys three-year series of skirmishes with the sisters. It was also the\\n\\nincident which eventually got him out of the laundry and into the library, where\\nhe filled out his work-time until he left our happy little family earlier this\\n\\nyear.\\n\\nYou may have noticed how much of what Ive told you already is hearsay-someone\\nsaw something and told me and I told you. Well, in some cases Ive simplified it\\neven more than it really was, and have repeated (or will repeat) fourth- or\\n\\nfifth-hand information. Thats the way it is here. The grapevine is very real,\\nand you have to use it if youre going to stay ahead. Also, of course, you have\\nto know how to pick out the grains of truth from the chaff of lies, rumors, and\\nwish-it-had-beens.\\n\\nYou may also have gotten the idea that Im describing someone whos more legend\\nthan man, and I would have to agree that theres some truth to that. To us\\n\\nlong-timers who knew Andy over a space of years, there was an element of fantasy\\nto him, a sense, almost, of myth-magic, if you get what I mean. That story I\\n\\npassed on about Andy refusing to give Bogs Diamond a head-job is part of that\\nmyth, and how he kept on fighting the sisters is part of it, and how he got the\\nlibrary job is part of it, too . . . but with one important difference: I was\\n\\nthere and I saw what happened, and I swear on my mothers name that its all\\ntrue. The oath of a convicted murderer may not be worth much, but believe this:\\nI dont lie.\\n\\nAndy and I were on fair speaking terms by then. The guy fascinated me. Looking\\nback to the poster episode, I see theres one thing I neglected to tell you, and\\nmaybe I should. Five weeks after he hung Rita up (Id forgotten all about it by\\nthen, and had gone on to other deals), Ernie passed a small white box through\\nthe bars of my cell.\\n\\n\"From Dufresne,\" he said, low, and never missed a stroke with his push-broom.\\n\"Thanks, Ernie,\" I said, and slipped him half a pack of Camels.\\n\\nNow what the hell was this, I was wondering as I slipped the cover from the box.\\nThere was a lot of white cotton inside, and below that . . .\\n\\nI looked for a long time. For a few minutes it was like I didnt even dare touch\\nthem, they were so pretty. Theres a crying shortage of pretty things in the\\nslam, and the real pity of it is that a lot of men dont even seem to miss \\nthem.\\n\\nThere were two pieces of quartz in that box, both of them carefully polished.\\nThey had been chipped into driftwood shapes. There were little sparkles of iron\\n\\n\\npyrites in them like flecks of gold. If they hadnt been so heavy, they would\\nhave served as a fine pair of mens cufflinks-they were that close to being a\\nmatched set.\\n\\nHow much work went into creating those two pieces? Hours and hours after\\nlights-out, I knew that. First the chipping and shaping, and then the almost\\nendless polishing and finishing with those rock-blankets. Looking at them, I\\nfelt the warmth that any man or woman feels when he or she is looking at\\n\\nsomething pretty, something that has been worked and made-thats the thing that\\nreally separates us from the animals, I think-and I felt something else, too. A\\nsense of awe for the mans brute persistence. But I never knew just how\\npersistent Andy Dufresne could be until much later.\\n\\nIn May of 1950, the powers that be decided that the roof of the license-plate\\nfactory ought to be re-surfaced with roofing tar. They wanted it done before it\\ngot too hot up there, and they asked for volunteers for the work, which was\\nplanned to take about a week. More than seventy men spoke up, because it was\\n\\noutside work and May is one damn fine month for outside work. Nine or ten names\\nwere drawn out of a hat, and two of them happened to be Andys and my own.\\n\\nFor the next week wed be marched out to the exercise yard after breakfast, with\\ntwo guards up front and two more behind . . . plus all the guards in the towers\\nkeeping a weather eye on the proceedings through their field-glasses for good\\nmeasure.\\n\\nFour of us would be carrying a big extension ladder on those morning marches - I\\nalways got a kick out of the way Dickie Betts, who was on that job, called that\\nsort of ladder an extensible - and wed put it up against the side of that low,\\n\\nflat building. Then wed start bucket-brigading hot buckets of tar up to the\\nroof. Spill that shit on you and youd jitterbug all the way to the infirmary.\\nThere were six guards on the project, all of them picked on the basis of\\nseniority. It was almost as good as a weeks vacation, because instead of\\nsweating it out in the laundry or the plate-shop or standing over a bunch of\\ncons cutting pulp or brush somewhere out in the fields, they were having a\\nregular May holiday in the sun, just sitting there with their backs up against\\nthe low parapet, shooting the bull back and forth.\\n\\nThey didnt even have to keep more than half an eye on us, because the south\\nwall sentry post was close enough so that the fellows up there could have spit\\ntheir chews on us, if theyd wanted to. If anyone on the roof-sealing party had\\nmade one funny move, it would take four seconds to cut him smack in two with\\n\\n.45-caliber machine-gun bullets. So those screws just sat there and took their\\nease. All they needed was a couple of six-packs buried in crushed ice, and they\\nwould have been the lords of all creation.\\n\\nOne of them was a fellow named Byron Hadley, and in that year of 1950, hed \\nbeen\\n\\n\\nat Shawshank longer than I had. Longer than the last two wardens put together,\\nas a matter of fact. The fellow running the show in 1950 was a prissy-looking\\n\\ndown-east Yankee named George Dunahy. He had a degree in penal administration.\\nNo one liked him, as far as I could tell, except the people who had gotten him \\nhis\\nappointment. I heard that he was only interested in three things: compiling\\n\\nstatistics for a book (which was later published by a small New England outfit\\ncalled Light Side Press, where he probably had to pay to have it done), which\\nteam won the intramural baseball championship each September, and getting a\\ndeath-penalty law passed in Maine. A regular bear for the death penalty was\\nGeorge Dunahy. He was fired from the job in 1953, when it came out he was\\nrunning a discount auto-repair service down in the prison garage and splitting\\n\\nthe profits with Byron Hadley and Greg Stammas. Hadley and Stammas came out of\\nthat one okay-they were old hands at keeping their asses covered-but Dunahy took\\na walk. No one was sorry to see him go, but nobody was exactly pleased to see\\nGreg Stammas step into his shoes, either. He was a short man with a tight, hard\\n\\ngut and the coldest brown eyes you ever saw. He always had a painful, pursed\\nlittle grin on his face, as if he had to go to the bathroom and couldnt quite\\nmanage it. During Stammass tenure as warden there was a lot of brutality at\\n\\nShawshank, and although I have no proof, I believe there were maybe half a dozen\\nmoonlight burials in the stand of scrub forest that lies east of the prison.\\n\\nDunahy was bad, but Greg Stammas was a cruel, wretched, cold-hearted man.\\n\\nHe and Byron Hadley were good friends. As warden, George Dunahy was nothing but\\na posturing figurehead; it was Stammas, and through him, Hadley, who actually\\nadministered the prison.\\n\\nHadley was a tall, shambling man with thinning red hair. He sunburned easily\\nand he talked loud and if you didnt move fast enough to suit him, hed clout \\nyou\\nwith his stick. On that day, our third on the roof, he was talking to another\\nguard named Mert Entwhistle.\\n\\nHadley had gotten some amazingly good news, so he was griping about it. That was\\nhis style-he was a thankless man with not a good word for anyone, a man who was\\nconvinced that the whole world was against him. The world had cheated him out of\\nthe best years of his life, and the world would be more than happy to cheat him\\n\\nout of the rest. I have seen some screws that I thought were almost saintly, and\\nI think I know why that happens -- they are able to see the difference between\\ntheir own lives, poor and struggling as they might be, and the lives of the men\\nthey are paid by the State to watch over. These guards are able to formulate a\\ncomparison concerning pain. Others cant, or wont.\\n\\nFor Byron Hadley there was no basis of comparison. He could sit there, cool and\\nat his ease under the warm May sun, and find the gall to mourn his own good luck\\nwhile less than ten feet away a bunch of men were working and sweating and\\nburning their hands on great big buckets filled with bubbling tar, men who had\\n\\n\\nto work so hard in their ordinary round of days that this looked like a \\nrespite.\\n\\nYou may remember the old question, the one thats supposed to define your\\noutlook on life when you answer it. For Byron Hadley the answer would always be\\nhalf empty, the glass is half empty. Forever and ever, amen. If you gave him a\\n\\ncool drink of apple cider, hed think about vinegar. If you told him his wife\\nhad always been faithful to him, hed tell you it was because she was so damn\\nugly.\\n\\nSo there he sat, talking to Mert Entwhistle loud enough for all of us to hear,\\nhis broad white forehead already starting to redden with the sun. He had one\\n\\nhand thrown back over the low parapet surrounding the roof. The other was on the\\nbutt of his .38.\\n\\nWe all got the story along with Mert. It seemed that Hadleys older brother had\\ngone off to Texas some fourteen years ago and the rest of the family hadnt\\nheard from the son of a bitch since. They had all assumed he was dead, and good\\nriddance. Then, a week and a half ago, a lawyer had called them long-distance\\nfrom Austin. It seemed that Hadleys brother had died four months ago, and a\\nrich man at that (\"Its frigging incredible how lucky some assholes can get,\"\\n\\nthis paragon of gratitude on the plate-shop roof said). The money had come as a\\nresult of oil and oil-leases, and there was close to a million dollars.\\n\\nNo, Hadley wasnt a millionaire-that might have made even him happy, at least\\nfor awhile-but the brother had left a pretty damned decent bequest of\\n\\nthirty-five thousand dollars to each surviving member of his family back in\\nMaine, if they could be found. Not bad. Like getting lucky and winning a\\nsweepstakes.\\n\\nBut to Byron Hadley the glass was always half empty. He spent most of the\\nmorning bitching to Mert about the bite that the goddam government was going to\\ntake out of his windfall. \"Theyll leave me about enough to buy a new car with,\"\\nhe allowed, \"and then what happens? You have to pay the damn taxes on the car,\\nand the repairs and maintenance, you got your goddam kids pestering you to take\\nem for a ride with the top down-\"\\n\\n\"And to drive it, if theyre old enough,\" Mert said. Old Mert Entwhistle knew\\nwhich side his bread was buttered on, and he didnt say what must have been as\\nobvious to him as to the rest of us: If that moneys worrying you so bad, Byron\\nold kid old sock, Ill just take it off your hands. After all, what are friends\\n\\nfor?\\n\\n\"Thats right, wanting to drive it, wanting to learn to drive on it, for\\nChrissake,\" Byron said with a shudder. \"Then what happens at the end of the\\nyear?         If you figured the tax wrong and you dont have enough left over \\nto pay\\nthe overdraft, you got to pay out of your own pocket, or maybe even borrow it\\n\\nfrom one of those kikey loan agencies. And they audit you anyway, you know. It\\n\\n\\ndont matter. And when the government audits you, they always take more. Who can\\nfight Uncle Sam? He puts his hand inside your shirt and squeezes your tit until\\n\\nits purple, and you end up getting the short end. Christ.\"\\n\\nHe lapsed into a morose silence, thinking of what terrible bad luck hed had to\\ninherit that thirty-five thousand dollars. Andy Dufresne had been spreading tar\\nwith a big brush less than fifteen feet away and now he tossed it into his\\n\\npail and walked over to where Mert and Hadley were sitting.\\n\\nWe all tightened up, and I saw one of the other screws, Tim Youngblood, drag his\\nhand down to where his pistol was holstered. One of the fellows in the sentry\\ntower struck his partner on the arm and they both turned, too. For one moment I\\nthought Andy was going to get shot, or clubbed, or both.\\n\\nThen he said, very softly, to Hadley: \"Do you trust your wife?\"\\n\\nHadley just stared at him. He was starting to get red in the face, and I knew\\nthat was a bad sign. In about three seconds he was going to pull his billy club\\nand give Andy the butt end of it right in the solar plexus, where that big \\nbundle\\nof nerves is. A hard enough hit there can kill you, but they always go for it. \\nIf\\nit doesnt kill you it will paralyze you long enough to forget whatever cute\\nmove it was that you had planned.\\n\\n\"Boy,\" Hadley said, \"Ill give you just one chance to pick up that brush. And\\nthen youre goin off this roof on your head.\"\\n\\nAndy just looked at him, very calm and still. His eyes were like ice. It was as\\nif he hadnt heard. And I found myself wanting to tell him how it was, to give\\nhim the crash course. The crash course is you never let on that you hear the\\nguards talking, you never try to horn in on their conversation unless youre\\nasked (and then you always tell them just what they want to hear and shut up\\nagain). Black man, white man, red man, yellow man, in prison it doesnt matter\\n\\nbecause weve got our own brand of equality. In prison every cons a low life, \\nand\\nyou have to get used to the idea if you intend to survive men like Hadley and\\n\\nGreg Stammas, who really would kill you just as soon as look at you. When youre\\nin stir you belong to the State and if you forget it, woe is you. Ive known men\\nwhove lost eyes, men whove lost toes and fingers; I knew one man who lost the\\ntip     of his penis and counted himself lucky that was all he lost. I wanted \\nto\\n\\ntell Andy that it was already too late. He could go back and pick up his brush\\nand there would still be some big lug waiting for him in the showers that night,\\nready to charley-horse both of his legs and leave him writhing on the cement.\\nYou could buy a lug like that for a pack of cigarettes or three Baby Ruths. Most\\nof all, I wanted to tell him not to make it any worse than it already was.\\n\\nWhat I did was to keep on running tar out onto the roof as if nothing at all \\nwas\\n\\n\\nhappening. Like everyone else, I look after my own ass first. I have to. Its\\ncracked already, and in Shawshank there have always been Hadleys willing to\\nfinish the job of breaking it.\\n\\nAndy said, \"Maybe I put it wrong. Whether you trust her or not is immaterial.\\nThe problem is whether or not you believe she would ever go behind your back,\\ntry to hamstring you.\"\\n\\nHadley got Up. Mert got up. Tim Youngblood got up. Hadleys face was as red as\\nthe side of a brick house. \"Your only problem,\" he said, \"is going to be how \\nmany\\nbones you still got unbroken. You can count them in the infirmary. Come on,\\nMert. Were throwing this sucker over the side.\"\\n\\nTim Youngblood drew his gun. The rest of us kept tarring like mad. The sun beat\\ndown. They were going to do it; Hadley and Mert were simply going to pitch him\\nover the side. Terrible accident. Dufresne, prisoner 81433-SHNK, was taking a\\ncouple of empties down and slipped on the ladder. Too bad.\\n\\nThey laid hold of him, Mert on the right arm, Hadley on the left. Andy didnt\\nresist. His eyes never left Hadleys red face.\\n\\n\"If youve got your thumb on her, Mr. Hadley,\" he said in that same calm,\\ncomposed voice, \"theres not a reason why you shouldnt have every cent of that\\nmoney. Final score, Mr. Byron Hadley thirty-five thousand, Uncle Sam zip.\"\\nMert started to drag him toward the edge.\\n\\nHadley just stood there. For a moment Andy was like a rope between them in a \\ntug-of-war\\ngame. Then Hadley said, \"Hold on one second, Mert. What do you mean, boy?\"\\n\\n\"I mean, if youve got your thumb on your wife, you can give it to her,\" Andy\\nsaid.\\n\\n\"You better start making sense, boy, or youre going over.\"\\n\\n\"The IRS allows you a one-time-only gift to your spouse,\" Andy said. \"Its good\\nup to sixty thousand dollars.\"\\n\\nHadley was now looking at Andy as if he had been poleaxed.\\n\"Naw, that aint right,\" he said. \"Tax free?\"\\n\\n\"Tax free,\" Andy said. \"IRS cant touch cent one.\"\\n\"How would you know a thing like that?\"\\n\\n\\nTim Youngblood said: \"He used to be a banker, Byron. I spose he might-\"\\n\"Shut ya head, Trout,\" Hadley said without looking at him.\\n\\nTim Youngblood flushed and shut up.  Some of the guards called him Trout \\nbecause of\\nhis thick lips and buggy eyes.  Hadley kept looking at Andy. \"Youre the smart\\n\\nbanker who shot his wife. Why should I believe a smart banker like you? So I can\\nwind up in here breaking rocks right alongside you? Youd like that, wouldnt\\nyou?\"\\n\\nAndy said quietly: \"If you went to jail for tax evasion, youd go to a federal\\npenitentiary, not Shawshank. But you wont. The tax-free gift to the spouse is a\\nperfectly legal loophole. Ive done dozens . . . no, hundreds of them. Its\\n\\nmeant primarily for people with small businesses to pass on, or for people who\\ncome into one-time-only windfalls. Like yourself.\"\\n\\n\"I think youre lying,\" Hadley said, but he didnt-you could see he didnt.\\n\\nThere was an emotion dawning on his face, something that was grotesque overlying\\nthat long, ugly countenance and that receding, sunburned brow. An almost obscene\\nemotion when seen on the features of Byron Hadley. It was hope.\\n\\n\"No, Im not lying. Theres no reason why you should take my word for it,\\neither. Engage a lawyer-\"\\n\\n\"Ambulance-chasing highway-robbing sob’s!\" Hadley cried.\\n\\nAndy shrugged. \"Then go to the IRS. Theyll tell you the same thing for free.\\nActually, you dont need me to tell you at all. You would have investigated the\\nmatter for yourself.\"\\n\\n\"You’re right. I dont need any smart wife-killing banker to show me where the\\nbears go in the woods.\"\\n\\n\"Youll need a tax lawyer or a banker to set up the gift for you and that will\\ncost you something,\" Andy said. \"Or . . . if you were interested, Id be glad to\\nset it up for you nearly free of charge. The price would be three beers apiece\\nfor my co-workers-\"\\n\\n\"Co-workers,\" Mert said, and let out a rusty guffaw. He slapped his knee. A real\\nknee-slapper was old Mert, and I hope he died of intestinal cancer in a part of\\nthe world where morphine is as of yet undiscovered. \"Co-workers, aint that\\ncute? Co-workers! You aint got any-\"\\n\\n\"Shut your friggin trap,\" Hadley growled, and Mert shut. Hadley looked at Andy\\nagain. \"What was you saying\\n\\n\\n\"I was saying that Id only ask three beers apiece for my coworkers, if that\\nseems fair,\" Andy said. \"I think a man feels more like a man when hes working\\nout of doors in the springtime if he can have a bottle of suds. Thats only my\\nopinion. It would go down smooth, and Im sure youd have their gratitude.\"\\n\\nI have talked to some of the other men who were up there that day - Rennie \\nMartin,\\nLogan St. Pierre, and Paul Bonsaint were three of them - and we all saw the same\\nthing then . . . felt the same thing. Suddenly it was Andy who had the upper\\n\\nhand. It was Hadley who had the gun on his hip and the billy in his hand, Hadley\\nwho had his friend Greg Stammas behind him and the whole prison administration\\nbehind Stammas, the whole power of the State behind that, but all at once in\\n\\nthat golden sunshine it didnt matter, and I felt my heart leap up in my chest\\n\\nas it never had since the truck drove me and four others through the gate back\\nin 1938 and I stepped out into the exercise yard.\\n\\nAndy was looking at Hadley with those cold, clear, calm eyes, and it wasnt just\\nthe thirty-five thousand then, we all agreed on that. Ive played it over and\\n\\nover in my mind and I know. It was man against man, and Andy simply forced\\nhim, the way a strong man can force a weaker mans wrist to the table in a game\\nof Indian rasseling. There was no reason, you see, why Hadley couldntve given\\nMert the nod at that very minute, pitched Andy overside onto his head, and still\\ntaken Andys advice.  No reason. But he didnt.\\n\\n\"I could get you all a couple of beers if I wanted to,\" Hadley said. \"A beer\\n\\ndoes taste good while youre working The colossal bastard even managed to sound\\nmagnanimous.\\n\\n\"Id just give you one piece of advice the IRS wouldnt bother with,\" Andy said.\\nHis eyes were Axed unwinkingly on Hadleys. \"Make the gift to your wife if\\nyoure sure. If you think theres even a chance she might double-cross you or\\nbackshoot you, we could work out something else -- \"\\n\\n\"Double-cross me?\" Hadley asked harshly. \"Double-cross me? Mr. Hotshot Banker,\\nif she ate her way through a boxcar of Ex-Lax, she wouldnt dare fart unless I\\n\\ngave her the nod.\"\\n\\nMert, Youngblood, and the other screws yucked it up dutifully. Andy never\\ncracked a smile.\\n\\n\"Ill write down the forms you need,\" he said. \"You can get them at the post\\noffice, and Ill fill them out for your signature.\"\\n\\nThat sounded suitably important, and Hadleys chest swelled. Then he glared\\naround at the rest of us and hollered, \"What are you jimmies starin at? Move\\n\\n\\nyour asses, goddammit!\" He looked back at Andy. \"You come over here with me,\\nhotshot. And listen to me well: if youre messin’ me somehow, youre gonna find\\nyourself chasing your own head around Shower C before the weeks out.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I understand that,\" Andy said softly.\\n\\nAnd he did understand it. The way it turned out, he understood a lot more than I\\ndid - more than any of us did.\\n\\nThats how, on the second-to-last day of the job, the convict crew that tarred\\nthe plate-factory roof in 1950 ended up sitting in a row at ten oclock on a\\nspring morning, drinking Black Label beer supplied by the hardest screw that\\never walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison. That beer was warm, but it\\nwas still the best I ever had in my life. We sat and drank it and felt the sun\\n\\non our shoulders, and not even the expression of half-amusement, half-contempt\\non Hadleys face-as if he were watching apes drink beer instead of men-could\\nspoil it. It lasted twenty minutes, that beer-break, and for those twenty\\n\\nminutes we felt like free men. We could have been drinking beer and tarring the\\nroof of one of our own houses.\\n\\nOnly Andy didnt drink. I already told you about his drinking habits. He sat\\nhunkered down in the shade, hands dangling between his knees, watching us and\\nsmiling a little. Its amazing how many men remember him that way, and amazing\\n\\nhow many men were on that work-crew when Andy Dufresne faced down Byron Hadley.\\n\\nI thought there were nine or ten of us, but by 1955 there must have been two\\nhundred of us, maybe more . . . if you believed what you heard.\\n\\nSo, yeah-if you asked me to give you a flat-out answer to the question of\\nwhether Im trying to tell you about a man or a legend that got made up around\\nthe man, like a pearl around a little piece of grit-Id have to say that the\\n\\nanswer lies somewhere in between. All I know for sure is that Andy Dufresne\\nwasnt much like me or anyone else I ever knew since I came inside. He brought\\n\\nin five hundred dollars jammed up his back porch, but somehow that graymeat son\\nof a bitch managed to bring in something else as well. A sense of his own worth,\\nmaybe, or a feeling that he would be the winner in the end . . . or maybe it was\\nonly        a sense of freedom, even inside these goddamned gray walls. It was \\na kind\\n\\nof inner light he carried around with him. I only knew him to lose that light\\nonce, and that is also a part of this story.\\n\\nVII\\n\\n\\nBy World Series time of 1950-this was the year the Philadelphia Whiz Kids\\ndropped four straight, you will remember-Andy was having no more trouble from\\nthe sisters. Stammas and Hadley had passed the word. If Andy Dufresne came to\\neither of them, or any of the other screws that formed a part of their coterie,\\n\\nand showed so much as a single drop of blood in his underpants, every sister in\\nShawshank would go to bed that night with a headache. They didnt fight it. As I\\nhave pointed out, there was always an eighteen-year old car thief or a firebug\\n\\nor some guy whod gotten his kicks handling little children. After the day on\\nthe plate-shop roof, Andy went his way and the sisters went theirs.\\n\\nHe was working in the library then, under a tough old con named Brooks Hatlen.\\nHatlen had gotten the job back in the late twenties because he had a college\\neducation. Brooksies degree was in animal husbandry, true enough, but college\\neducations in institutes of lower learning like The Shank are so rare that its\\n\\na case of beggars not being able to be choosers.\\n\\nIn 1952 Brooksie, who had killed his wife and daughter after a losing streak at\\npoker back when Coolidge was President, was paroled. As usual, the State in all\\nits wisdom had let him go long after any chance he might have had to become a\\nuseful part of society was gone. He was sixty-eight and arthritic when he\\ntottered  out of the main gate in his Polish suit and his French shoes, his\\n\\nparole papers in one hand and a Greyhound bus ticket in the other. He was crying\\nwhen he left. Shawshank was his world. What lay beyond its walls was as terrible\\nto Brooks as the Western Seas had been to superstitious fifteenth-century\\n\\nsailors. In prison, Brooksie had been a person of some importance. He was the\\nlibrarian, an educated man. If he went to the Kittery library and asked for a\\njob, they wouldnt even give him a library card. I heard he died in a home for\\nindigent old folks up Freeport way in 1953, and at that he lasted about six\\n\\nmonths longer than I thought he would. Yeah, I guess the State got its own back\\non Brooksie, all right. They trained him to like it inside the shithouse and\\n\\nthen they threw him out.\\n\\nAndy succeeded to Brooksies job, and he was librarian for twenty-three years.\\nHe used the same force of will Id seen him use on Byron Hadley to get what he\\nwanted for the library, and I saw him gradually turn one small room (which still\\nsmelled of turpentine because it had been a paint closet until 1922 and had\\nnever  been properly aired) lined with Readers Digest Condensed Books and\\nNational Geographies into the best prison library in New England.\\n\\nHe did it a step at a time. He put a suggestion box by the door and patiently\\n\\nweeded out such attempts at humor as More Fuk-Boox Pleeze and Excape in 10 EZ\\nLesions. He got hold of the things the prisoners seemed serious about. He wrote\\n\\nto the major book clubs in New York and got two of them, The Literary Guild and\\nThe Book-of-the-Month Club, to send editions of all their major selections to \\nus\\n\\n\\nat a special cheap rate. He discovered a hunger for information on such small\\nhobbies as soap-carving, woodworking, sleight of hand, and card solitaire. He\\ngot     all the books he could on such subjects. And those two jailhouse \\nstaples,\\nErie Stanley Gardner and Louis LAmour. Cons never seem to get enough of the\\ncourtroom or the open range. And yes, he did keep a box of fairly spicy\\npaperbacks   under the checkout desk, loaning them out carefully and making sure\\nthey always got back. Even so, each new acquisition of that type was quickly\\nread to tatters.\\n\\nHe began to write to the State Senate in Augusta in 1954. Stammas was warden by\\nthen, and he used to pretend Andy was some sort of mascot. He was always in the\\nlibrary, shooting the bull with Andy, and sometimes hed even throw a paternal\\n\\narm around Andys shoulders or give him a goose. He didnt fool anybody. Andy\\nDufresne was no ones mascot.\\n\\nHe told Andy that maybe hed been a banker on the outside, but that part of his\\nlife was receding rapidly into his past and he had better get a hold on the\\n\\nfacts of prison life. As far as that bunch of jumped-up Republican Rotarians in\\nAugusta was concerned, there were only three viable expenditures of the\\ntaxpayers money in the field of prisons and corrections. Number one was more\\n\\nwalls, number two was more bars, and number three was more guards. As far as the\\nState Senate was concerned, Stammas explained, the folks in Thomastan and\\nShawshank and Pittsfield and South Portland were the scum of the earth. They\\nwere there to do hard time, and by God and Sonny Jesus, it was hard time they\\nwere going to do. And if there were a few weevils in the bread, wasnt that \\njust\\n\\ntoo fucking bad?\\n\\nAndy smiled his small, composed smile and asked Stammas what would happen to a\\nblock of concrete if a drop of water fell on it once every year for a million\\n\\nyears. Stammas laughed and clapped Andy on the back. \"You got no million years,\\nold horse, but if you did, I bleeve youd do it with that same little grin on\\n\\nyour face. You go on and write your letters. Ill even mail them for you if you\\npay for the stamps.\"\\n\\nWhich Andy did. And he had the last laugh, although Stammas and Hadley werent\\naround to see it. Andys requests for library funds were routinely turned down\\nuntil 1960, when he received a check for two hundred dollars-the Senate probably\\nappropriated it in hopes that he would shut up and go away. Vain hope. Andy felt\\nthat he had finally gotten one foot in the door and he simply redoubled his\\n\\nefforts; two letters a week instead of one. In 1962 he got four hundred dollars,\\nand for the rest of the decade the library received seven hundred dollars a year\\nlike clockwork. By 1971 that had risen to an even thousand. Not much stacked up\\nagainst what your average small-town library receives, I guess, but a thousand\\nbucks can buy a lot of recycled Perry Mason stories and Jake Logan Westerns. By\\nthe time Andy left, you could go into the library (expanded from its original\\n\\n\\npaint-locker to three rooms), and find just about anything youd want. And if\\nyou couldnt find it, chances were good that Andy could get it for you.\\n\\nNow youre asking yourself if all this came about just because Andy told Byron\\nHadley how to save the taxes on his windfall inheritance. The answer is yes.\\n\\nAnd no. You can probably figure out what happened for yourself.\\n\\nWord got around that Shawshank was housing its very own pet financial wizard. In\\nthe late spring and the summer of 1950, Andy set up two trust funds for guards\\nwho wanted to assure a college education for their kids, he advised a couple of\\nothers who wanted to take small fliers in common stock (and they did pretty damn\\nwell, as things turned out; one of them did so well he was able to take an early\\nretirement two years later), and Ill be damned if he didnt advise the warden\\nhimself, old Lemon Lips George Dunahy, on how to go about setting up a\\n\\ntax-shelter for himself. That was just before Dunahy got the bums rush, and I\\nbelieve he must have been dreaming about all the millions his book was going to\\nmake him. By April of 1951, Andy was doing the tax returns for half the screws\\nat Shawshank, and by 1952, he was doing almost all of them. He was paid in what\\nmay be a prisons most valuable coin: simple good will.\\n\\nLater on, after Greg Stammas took over the wardens office, Andy became even\\nmore important-but if I tried to tell you the specifics of just how, Id be\\nguessing. There are some things I know about and others I can only guess at. I\\nknow that there were some prisoners who received all sorts of special\\nconsiderations-radios in their cells, extraordinary visiting privileges, things\\n\\nlike that-and there were people on the outside who were paying for them to have\\nthose privileges. Such people are known as \"angels\" by the prisoners. All at\\n\\nonce some fellow would be excused from working in the plate-shop on Saturday\\nforenoons, and youd know that fellow had an angel out there whod coughed up a\\nchunk  of dough to make sure it happened. The way it usually works is that the\\nangel will pay the bribe to some middle-level screw, and the screw will spread\\n\\nthe grease both up and down the administrative ladder.\\n\\nThen there was the discount auto-repair service that laid Warden Dunahy low. It\\nwent underground for awhile and then emerged stronger than ever in the late\\nfifties. And some of the contractors that worked at the prison from time to time\\nwere paying kickbacks to the top administration officials, Im pretty sure, and\\n\\nthe same was almost certainly true of the companies whose equipment was bought\\nand installed in the laundry and the license-plate shop and the stamping-mill\\n\\nthat was built in 1963.\\n\\nBy the late sixties there was also a booming trade in pills, and the same\\nadministrative crowd was involved in turning a buck on that. All of it added up\\nto              a pretty good-sized river of illicit income. Not like the pile \\nof clandestine\\nbucks that must fly around a really big prison like Attica or San Quentin, but\\n\\n\\nnot peanuts, either. And money itself becomes a problem after awhile. You cant\\njust stuff it into your wallet and then shell out a bunch of crumpled twenties\\n\\nand dog-eared tens when you want a pool built in your back yard or an addition\\nput on your house. Once you get past a certain point, you have to explain where\\nthat money came from . . . and if your explanations arent convincing enough,\\nyoure apt to wind up wearing a number yourself.\\n\\nSo there was a need for Andys services. They took him out of the laundry and\\ninstalled him in the library, but if you wanted to look at it another way, they\\nnever took him out of the laundry at all. They just set him to work washing\\ndirty money instead of dirty sheets He funneled it into stocks, bonds, tax-free\\nmunicipals, you name it.\\n\\nHe told me once about ten years after that day on the plate-shop roof that his\\nfeelings about what he was doing were pretty clear, and that his conscience was\\nrelatively untroubled. The rackets would have gone on with him or without him.\\n\\nHe had not asked to be sent to Shawshank, he went on; he was an innocent man who\\nhad been victimized by colossal bad luck, not a missionary or a do-gooder.\\n\\n\"Besides, Red,\" he told me with that same half-grin, \"what Im doing in here\\nisnt all that different from what I was doing outside. Ill hand you a pretty\\ncynical axiom: the amount of expert financial help an individual or company\\nneeds rises in direct proportion to how many people that person or business is\\nscrewing.\\n\\n\"The people who run this place are stupid, brutal monsters for the most part.\\n\\nThe people who run the straight world are brutal and monstrous, but they happen\\nnot to be quite as stupid, because the standard of competence out there is a\\n\\nlittle higher. Not much, but a little. \"\\n\\n\"But the pills,\" I said. \"I dont want to tell you your business, but they make\\n\\nme nervous. Reds, uppers, downers, Nembutals- now theyve got these things they\\ncall Phase Fours. I wont get anything like that. Never have.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" Andy said. \"I dont like the pills, either. Never have. But Im not much\\nof a one for cigarettes or booze, either. But I dont push the pills. I dont\\nbring them in, and I dont sell them once they are in. Mostly its the screws\\nwho do that.\"\\n\\n\"But-\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, I know. Theres a fine line there. What it comes down to, Red, is some\\npeople refuse to get their hands dirty at all. Thats called sainthood, and the\\npigeons land on your shoulders and crap all over your shirt. The other extreme\\nis to take a bath in the dirt and deal any goddamned thing that will turn a\\n\\n\\ndollar-guns, switchblades big H. what the hell. You ever have a con come up to\\nyou and offer you a contract?\"\\n\\nI nodded. Its happened a lot of times over the years. You are, after all, the\\nman who can get it. And they figure if you can get them batteries for their\\ntransistor radios or cartons of Luckies or lids of reefer, you can put them in\\ntouch with a guy wholl use a knife. \"Sure you have,\" Andy agreed. \"But you\\ndont do it. Because guys like us, Red, we know theres a third choice. An\\nalternative to staying simon-pure or bathing in the filth and the slime. Its\\n\\nthe alternative that grown-ups all over the world pick. You balance off your\\nwalk through the hog-wallow against what it gains you. You choose the lesser of\\ntwo evils and try to keep your good intentions in front of you. And I guess you\\njudge how well youre doing by how well you sleep at night . . . and what your\\ndreams are like. \"\\n\\n\"Good intentions,\" I said, and laughed. \"I know all about that Andy. A fellow\\ncan toddle right off to hell on that road.\"\\n\\n\"Dont you believe it,\" he said, growing somber. \"This is hell right here. Right\\nhere in The Shank. They sell pills and I tell them what to do with the money.\\nBut Ive also got the library, and I know of over two dozen guys who have used\\nthe books in there to help them pass their high school equivalency tests. Maybe\\nwhen they get out of here theyll be able to crawl off the shit heap. When we\\nneeded that second room back in 1957, I got it. Because they want to keep me\\nhappy. I work cheap. Thats the trade-off.\"\\n\\n\"And youve got your own private quarters.\"\\n\"Sure. Thats the way I like it.\"\\n\\nThe prison population had risen slowly all through the fifties, and it damn near\\nexploded in the sixties, what with every college-age kid in America wanting to\\ntry dope and the perfectly ridiculous penalties for the use of a little reefer.\\n\\nBut in all that time Andy never had a cellmate, except for a big, silent Indian\\nnamed Normaden (like all Indians in The Shank, he was called Chief), and\\nNormaden didnt last long. A lot of the other long-timers thought Andy was\\ncrazy, but Andy just smiled. He lived alone and he liked it that way . . . and\\nas hed said, they liked to keep him happy. He worked cheap.\\n\\nPrison time is slow time, sometimes youd swear its stop-time, but it passes. \\nIt passes.\\nGeorge Dunahy departed the scene in a welter of newspaper headlines shouting\\nSCANDAL and NEST-FEATHERING.  Stammas succeeded him, and for the next six\\nyears Shawshank was a kind of living hell. During the reign of Greg Stammas the \\nbeds in\\nthe infirmary and the cells in the Solitary Wing were always full.\\n\\n\\nOne day in 1958 I looked at myself in a small shaving mirror I kept in my cell\\n\\nand saw a forty-year-old man looking back at me. A kid had come in back in 1938,\\na kid with a big mop of carroty red hair, half-crazy with remorse, thinking\\n\\nabout suicide. That kid was gone. The red hair was going gray and starting to\\nrecede. There were crows tracks around the eyes. On that day I could see an old\\nman inside, waiting his time to come out. It scared me. Nobody wants to grow old\\nin stir.\\n\\nStammas went early in 1959. There had been several investigative reporters\\nsniffing around, and one of them even did four months under an assumed name, for\\na crime made up out of whole cloth. They were getting ready to drag out\\n\\nSCANDAL and NEST-FEATHERING again, but before they could bring the hammer\\ndown on him, Stammas ran. I can understand that; boy, can I ever. If he had \\nbeen tried\\nand convicted, he could have ended up right in here. If so, he might have \\nlasted all\\n\\nof five hours. Byron Hadley had gone two years earlier. The sucker had a heart\\nattack and took an early retirement.\\n\\nAndy never got touched by the Stammas affair. In early 1959 a new warden was\\nappointed, and a new assistant warden, and a new chief of guards. For the next\\neight months or so, Andy was just another con again. It was during that period\\nthat Normaden, the big half-breed Passamaquoddy, shared Andys cell with him.\\nThen everything just started up again. Normaden was moved out, and Andy was\\nliving in solitary splendor again. The names at the top change, but the rackets\\nnever do.\\n\\nI talked to Normaden once about Andy. \"Nice Della,\" Normaden said. It was hard\\nto make out anything he said because he had a harelip and a cleft palate; his\\nwords all came out in a slush. \"I liked it there. He never made fun. But he\\n\\ndidnt want me there. I could tell.\" Big shrug. \"I was glad to go, me. Bad draft\\nin that cell. All the time cold. He dont let nobody touch his things. Thats\\nokay. Nice man, never made fun. But big draft.\"\\n\\nVIII\\n\\n\\nRita Hayworth hung in Andys cell until 1955, if I remember right. Then it was\\nMarilyn Monroe, that picture from The Seven-Year Itch where shes standing over\\na subway grating and the warm air is flipping her skirt up. Marilyn lasted until\\n1960, and she was considerably tattered about the edges when Andy replaced her\\nwith Jayne Mansfield. Jayne was, you should pardon the expression, a bust. After\\nonly a year or so she was replaced with an English actress-might have been \\nHazel\\n\\nCourt, but Im not sure. In 1966 that one came down and Raquel Welch went up for\\na record breaking six-year engagement in Andys cell. The last poster to hang\\n\\nthere was a pretty country-rock singer whose name was Linda Ronstadt.\\n\\nI asked him once what the posters meant to him, and he gave me a peculiar,\\nsurprised sort of look. \"Why, they mean the same thing to me as they do to most\\ncons,   I guess,\" he said. \"Freedom. You look at those pretty women and you feel\\nlike you could almost . . . not quite but almost . . . step right through and be\\nbeside them. Be free. I guess thats why I always liked Raquel Welch the best.\\n\\nIt wasnt just her; it was that beach she was standing on. Looked like she was\\ndown in Mexico somewhere. Someplace quiet, where a man would be able to hear\\nhimself think. Didnt you ever feel that way about a picture, Red? That you\\n\\ncould almost step right through it?\"\\n\\nI said Id never really thought of it that way.\\n\\n\"Maybe someday youll see what I mean,\" he said, and he was right. Years later I\\nsaw exactly what he meant . . . and when I did, the first thing I thought of was\\nNormaden, and about how hed said it was always cold in Andys cell.\\n\\nA terrible thing happened to Andy in late March or early April of 1963. I have\\ntold you that he had something that most of the other prisoners, myself\\nincluded, seemed to lack. Call it a sense of equanimity, or a feeling of inner\\npeace, maybe even a constant and unwavering faith that someday the long\\nnightmare would end.\\n\\nWhatever you want to call it, Andy Dufresne always seemed to have his act\\ntogether. There was none of that sullen desperation about him that seems to\\nafflict most lifers after awhile; you could never smell hopelessness on him.\\n\\nUntil that late winter of 63.\\n\\nWe had another warden by then, a man named Samuel Norton. The Mathers, Cotton\\nand Increase, would have felt right at home with Sam Norton. So far as I know,\\n\\nno one had ever seen him so much as crack a smile. He had a thirty-year pin from\\nthe Baptist Advent Church of Eliot. His major innovation as the head of our\\nhappy family was to make sure that each incoming prisoner had a New Testament.\\nHe had a small plaque on his desk, gold letters inlaid in teakwood, which said\\nCHRIST IS MY SAVIOR. A sampler on the wall, made by his wife, read:\\n\\n\\nHIS JUDGMENT COMETH AND THAT RIGHT EARLY.\\n\\nThis latter sentiment cut zero ice with most of us.\\n\\nWe felt that the judgment had already occurred, and we would be willing to\\ntestify with the best of them that the rock would not hide us nor the dead tree\\ngive us shelter. He had a Bible quote for every occasion, did Mr. Sam Norton,\\nand whenever you meet a man like that, my best advice to you would be to grin\\nbig and cover up your balls with both hands.\\n\\nThere were less infirmary cases than in the days of Greg Stammas, and so far as\\nI know the moonlight burials ceased altogether, but this is not to say that\\n\\nNorton was not a believer in punishment. Solitary was always well populated. Men\\nlost their teeth not from beatings but from bread and water diets. It began to\\n\\nbe called grain and drain, as in \"Im on the Sam Norton grain and drain train,\\nboys.\"\\n\\nThe man was the foulest hypocrite that I ever saw in a high position. The\\nrackets I told you about earlier continued to flourish, but Sam Norton added his\\nown new wrinkles. Andy knew about them all, and because we had gotten to be\\n\\npretty good friends by that time, he let me in on some of them. When Andy talked\\nabout them, an expression of amused, disgusted wonder would come over his face,\\nas if he were telling me about some ugly, predatory species of bug that was, by\\n\\nits very ugliness and greed, somehow more comic than terrible.\\n\\nIt was Warden Norton who instituted the \"Inside-Out\" program you may have read\\nabout some sixteen or seventeen years back; it was even written up in Newsweek.\\nIn the press it sounded like a real advance in practical corrections and\\nrehabilitation. There were prisoners out cutting pulpwood, prisoners repairing\\nbridges           and causeways, prisoners constructing potato cellars. Norton \\ncalled it\\n\"Inside-Out\" and was invited to explain it to damn near every Rotary and Kiwanis\\nclub           in New England, especially after he got his picture in Newsweek. \\nThe\\nprisoners called it \"road-ganging,\" but so far as I know, none of them were ever\\ninvited    to express their views to the Kiwanians or the Loyal Order of Moose.\\n\\nNorton was right in there on every operation, thirty-year churchpin and all;\\nfrom cutting pulp to digging storm-drains to laying new culverts under state\\n\\nhighways, there was Norton, skimming off the top. There were a hundred ways to\\ndo it-men, materials, you name it. But he had it coming another way, as well.\\n\\nThe construction businesses in the area were deathly afraid of Nortons\\n\\nInside-Out program, because prison labor is slave labor, and you cant compete\\nwith that. So Sam Norton, he of the Testaments and the thirty-year church-pin,\\nwas passed a good many thick envelopes under the table during his sixteen-year\\ntenure as Shawshanks warden. And when an envelope was passed, he would either\\n\\n\\noverbid the project, not bid at all, or claim that all his Inside-Outers were\\ncommitted elsewhere. It has always been something of a wonder to me that Norton\\nwas never found in the trunk of a Thunderbird parked off a highway somewhere\\ndown in Massachusetts with his hands tied behind his back and half a dozen\\n\\nbullets in his head.\\n\\nAnyway, as the old barrelhouse song says, My God, how the money rolled in.\\nNorton must have subscribed to the old Puritan notion that the best way to\\nfigure out which folks God favors is by checking their bank accounts.\\n\\nAndy Dufresne was his right hand in all of this, his silent partner. The prison\\nlibrary was Andys hostage to fortune. Norton knew it, and Norton used it. Andy\\ntold me that one of Nortons favorite aphorisms was One hand washes the other.\\nSo Andy gave good advice and made useful suggestions. I cant say for sure that\\nhe handtooled Nortons Inside-Out program, but Im damned sure he processed the\\nmoney for the Jesus-shouting son of a whore. He gave good advice, made useful\\nsuggestions, the money got spread around, and . . . son of a bitch! The library\\nwould           get a new set of automotive repair manuals, a fresh set of \\nGrolier\\nEncyclopedias, books on how to prepare for the Scholastic Achievement Tests.\\n\\nAnd, of course, more Erle Stanley Gardners and more Louis LAmours.\\n\\nAnd Im convinced that what happened happened because Norton just didnt want to\\nlose his good right hand. Ill go further: it happened because he was scared of\\n\\nwhat might happen-what Andy might say against him-if Andy ever got clear of\\nShawshank State Prison.\\n\\nI got the story a chunk here and a chunk there over a space of seven years, some\\nof it from Andy-but not all. He never wanted to talk about that part of his\\n\\nlife, and I dont blame him. I got parts of it from maybe half a dozen different\\nsources. Ive said once that prisoners are nothing but slaves, but they have\\n\\nthat slave habit of looking dumb and keeping their ears open. I got it backwards\\nand forwards and in the middle, but Ill give it to you from point A to point Z.\\nand maybe youll understand why the man spent about ten months in a bleak,\\ndepressed daze. See, I dont think he knew the truth until 1963, fifteen years\\nafter        he came into this sweet little hellhole. Until he met Tommy \\nWilliams, I\\ndont think he knew how bad it could get.\\n\\nTommy Williams joined our happy little Shawshank family in November of 1962.\\nTommy thought of himself as a native of Massachusetts, but he wasnt proud; in\\nhis twenty-seven years hed done time all over New England. He was a\\nprofessional thief, and as you may have guessed, my own feeling was that he\\nshould have picked another profession.\\n\\nHe was a married man, and his wife came to visit each and every week. She had an\\nidea that things might go better with Tommy- and consequently better with their\\n\\n\\nthree-year-old son and herself- if he got his high school degree. She talked him\\ninto it, and so Tommy Williams started visiting the library on a regular basis.\\n\\nFor Andy, this was an old routine by then. He saw that Tommy got a series of\\nhigh school equivalency tests. Tommy would brush up on the subjects he had\\npassed in high school-there werent many-and then take the test. Andy also saw\\nthat  he was enrolled in a number of correspondence courses covering the \\nsubjects\\nhe had failed in school or just missed by dropping out.\\n\\nHe probably wasnt the best student Andy ever took over the jumps, and I dont\\nknow if he ever did get his high school diploma, but that forms no part of my\\nstory. The important thing was that he came to like Andy Dufresne very much, as\\nmost people did after awhile.\\n\\nOn a couple of occasions he asked Andy \"what a smart guy like you is doing in\\nthe joint\"-a question which is the rough equivalent of that one that goes\\n\"Whats a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?\" But Andy wasnt the\\ntype to tell him; he would only smile and turn the conversation into some other\\n\\nchannel. Quite normally, Tommy asked someone else, and when he finally got the\\nstory, I guess he also got the shock of his young life.\\n\\nThe person he asked was his partner on the laundrys steam ironer and folder.\\nThe inmates call this device the mangler, because thats exactly what it will do\\nto you if you arent paying attention and get your bad self caught in it. His\\n\\npartner was Charlie Lathrop, who had been in for about twelve years on a murder\\ncharge. He was more than glad to reheat the details of the Dufresne murder trial\\nfor Tommy; it broke the monotony of pulling freshly pressed bedsheets out of the\\nmachine and tucking them into the basket. He was just getting to the jury\\n\\nwaiting until after lunch to bring in their guilty verdict when the trouble\\nwhistle went off and the mangle grated to a stop. They had been feeding in\\nfreshly washed sheets from the Eliot Nursing Home at the far end; these were\\nspat out dry and neatly pressed at Tommys and Charlies end at the rate of one\\nevery five seconds. Their job was to grab them, fold them, and slap them into\\nthe cart, which had already been lined with clean brown paper.\\n\\nBut Tommy Williams was just standing there, staring at Charlie Lathrop, his\\nmouth unhinged all the way to his chest. He was standing in a drift of sheets\\n\\nthat had come through clean and which were now sopping up all the wet muck on\\nthe floor-and in a laundry wetwash, theres plenty of muck.\\n\\nSo the head bull that day, Homer Jessup, comes rushing over, bellowing his head\\noff and on the prod for trouble. Tommy took no notice of him. He spoke to\\nCharlie as if old Homer, who had busted more heads than he could probably count,\\nhadnt been there.\\n\\n\\n\"What did you say that golf pros name was?\"\\n\\n\"Quentin,\" Charlie answered back, all confused and upset by now. He later said\\nthat the kid was as white as a truce flag. \"Glenn Quentin, I think. Something\\nlike that, anyway-\"\\n\\n\"Here now, here now,\" Homer Jessup roared, his neck as red as a roosters comb.\\n\"Get them sheets in cold water! Get quick! Get quick, by Jesus, you-\"\\n\\n\"Glenn Quentin, oh my God,\" Tommy Williams said, and that was all he got to say\\nbecause Homer Jessup, that least peaceable of men, brought his billy down behind\\nhis ear. Tommy hit the floor so hard he broke off three of his front teeth. \\nWhen\\n\\nhe woke up he was in solitary, and confined to same for a week, riding a boxcar\\non Sam Nortons famous grain and drain train. Plus a black mark on his report\\ncard.\\n\\nThat was in early February of 1963, and Tommy Williams went around to six or\\nseven other long-timers after he got out of solitary and got pretty much the\\n\\nsame story. I know; I was one of them. But when I asked him why he wanted it, he\\njust clammed up.\\n\\nThen one day he went to the library and spilled one helluva big budget of\\ninformation to Andy Dufresne. And for the first and last time, at least since he\\nhad approached me about the Rita Hayworth poster like a kid buying his first\\npack of Trojans, Andy lost his cool . . . only this time he blew it entirely.\\n\\nI saw him later that day, and he looked like a man who has stepped on the\\nbusiness end of a rake and given himself a good one, whap between the eyes. His\\nhands were trembling, and when I spoke to him, he didnt answer. Before that\\nafternoon was out he had caught up with Billy Hanlon, who was the head screw,\\nand     set up an appointment with Warden Norton for the following day. He told \\nme\\nlater that he didnt sleep a wink all that night; he just listened to a cold\\n\\nwinter wind howling outside, watched the searchlights go around and around,\\nputting long, moving shadows on the cement walls of the cage he had called home\\nsince Harry Truman was President, and tried to think it all out. He said it was\\n\\nas if Tommy had produced a key which fit a cage in the back of his mind, a cage\\nlike his own cell. Only instead of holding a man, that cage held a tiger, and\\n\\nthat tigers name was Hope. Williams had produced the key that unlocked the cage\\nand the tiger was out, willy-nilly, to roam his brain.\\n\\nFour years before, Tommy Williams had been arrested in Rhode Island, driving a\\nstolen car that was full of stolen merchandise. Tommy turned in his accomplice,\\nthe DA played ball, and he got a lighter sentence . . . two to four, with time\\nserved. Eleven months after beginning his term, his old cellmate got a ticket\\n\\nout and Tommy got a new one, a man named Elwood Blatch. Blatch had been busted\\n\\n\\nfor burglary with a weapon and was serving six to twelve.\\n\\n\"I never seen such a high-strung guy,\" Tommy told me. \"A man like that should\\nnever want to be a burglar, specially not with a gun. The slightest little\\n\\nnoise, hed go three feet into the air . . . and come down shooting, more likely\\nthan not. One night he almost strangled me because some guy down the hall was\\nwhopping on his cell bars with a tin cup.\\n\\n\"I did seven months with him, until they let me walk free. I got time served and\\ntime off, you understand. I cant say we talked because you didnt, you know,\\nexactly hold a conversation with El Blatch. He held a conversation with you. He\\ntalked all the time. Never shut up. If you tried to get a word in, hed shake\\n\\nhis fist at you and roll his eyes. It gave me the cold chills whenever he done\\nthat. Big tall guy he was, mostly bald, with these green eyes set way down deep\\nin the sockets. Jeez, I hope I never see him again.\\n\\n\"It was like a talkin jag every night. Where he grew up, the orphanages he run\\naway from, the jobs he done, the women he fucked, the crap games he cleaned out.\\nI just let him run on. My face aint much, but I didnt want it, you know,\\n\\nrearranged for me.\\n\\n\"According to him, hed burgled over two hundred joints. It was hard for me to\\nbelieve, a guy like him who went off like a firecracker every time someone cut a\\nloud fart, but he swore it was true. Now . . . listen to me, Red. I know guys\\nsometimes make things up after they know a thing, but even before I knew about\\nthis golf pro guy, Quentin, I remember thinking that if El Blatch ever burgled\\n\\nmy house, and I found out about it later, Id have to count myself just about\\nthe luckiest motherfucker going still to be alive. Can you imagine him in some\\nladys bedroom, sifting through her joolry box, and she coughs in her sleep or\\nturns over quick? It gives me the cold chills just to think of something like\\nthat,   I swear on my mothers name it does.\\n\\n\"He said hed killed people, too. People that gave him shit. At least thats\\n\\nwhat he said. And I believed him. He sure looked like a man that could do some\\nkilling. He was just so fucking highstrung! Like a pistol with a sawed-off\\n\\nfiring pin. I knew a guy who had a Smith and Wesson Police Special with a\\nsawed-off firing pin. It wasnt no good for nothing, except maybe for something\\nto      jaw about. The pull on that gun was so light that it would fire if this \\nguy,\\nJohnny Callahan, his name was, if he turned his record-player on full volume and\\nput  it on top of one of the speakers. Thats how El Blatch was. I cant \\nexplain\\n\\nit any better. I just never doubted that he had greased some people.\\n\\n\"So one night, just for something to say, I go: Whod you kill? Like a joke,\\n\\nyou know. So he laughs and says: Theres one guy doing time up-Maine for these\\ntwo people I killed. It was this guy and the wife of the slob whos doing the\\n\\n\\ntime. I was creeping their place and the guy started to give me some shit.\\n\\n\"I cant remember if he ever told me the womans name or not,\" Tommy went on.\\n\"Maybe he did. But in New England, Dufresnes like Smith or Jones in the rest of\\nthe country, because theres so many Frogs up here. Dufresne, Lavesque,\\n\\nOuelette, Poulin, who can remember Frog names? But he told me the guys name. He\\nsaid the guy was Glenn Quentin and he was a prick, a big rich prick, a golf \\npro.\\n\\nEl said he thought the guy might have cash in the house, maybe as much as five\\nthousand dollars. That was a lot of money back then, he says to me. So I go:\\nWhen was that? And he goes: After the war. Just after the war.\\n\\n\"So he went in and he did the joint and they woke up and the guy gave him some\\ntrouble. Thats what El said. Maybe the guy just started to snore, thats what \\nI\\n\\nsay. Anyway, El said Quentin was in the sack with some hotshot lawyers wife and\\nthey sent the lawyer up to Shawshank State Prison. Then he laughs this big\\n\\nlaugh. Holy Christ, I was never so glad of anything as I was when I got my\\nwalking papers from that place.\"\\n\\nIX\\n\\n\\nI guess you can see why Andy went a little wonky when Tommy told him that story,\\nand why he wanted to see the warden right away. Elwood Blatch had been serving a\\nsix-to-twelve rap when Tommy knew him four years before. By the time Andy heard\\nall of this, in 1963, he might be on the verge of getting out . . . or already\\n\\nout. So those were the two prongs of the spit Andy was roasting on-the idea that\\nBlatch might still be in on one hand, and the very real possibility that he\\n\\nmight be gone like the wind on the other.\\n\\nThere were inconsistencies in Tommys story, but arent there always in real\\n\\nlife? Blatch told Tommy the man who got sent up was a hotshot lawyer, and Andy\\nwas a banker, but those are two professions that people who arent very educated\\ncould easily get mixed up. And dont forget that twelve years had gone by\\nbetween the time Blatch was reading the clippings about the trial and the time\\n\\nhe told the tale to Tommy Williams. He also told Tommy he got better than a\\nthousand dollars from a footlocker Quentin had in his closet, but the police\\nsaid at Andys trial that there had been no sign of burglary. I have a few ideas\\nabout that. First, if you take the cash and the man it belonged to is dead, how\\nare you going to know anything was stolen, unless someone else can tell you it\\nwas there to start with? Second, whos to say Blatch wasnt lying about that\\npart of it? Maybe he didnt want to admit killing two people for nothing. \\nThird,\\n\\nmaybe there were signs of burglary and the cops either overlooked them-cops can\\nbe pretty dumb-or deliberately covered them up so they wouldnt screw the DAs\\ncase. The guy was running for public office, remember, and he needed a\\n\\nconviction to run on. An unsolved burglary-murder would have done him no good at\\nall.\\n\\nBut of the three, I like the middle one best. Ive known a few Elwood Blatches\\nin my time at Shawshank-the trigger-pullers with the crazy eyes. Such fellows\\n\\nwant you to think they got away with the equivalent of the Hope Diamond on every\\ncaper, even if they got caught with a two-dollar Timex and nine bucks on the one\\ntheyre doing time for.\\n\\nAnd there was one thing in Tommys story that convinced Andy beyond a shadow of\\na doubt. Blatch hadnt hit Quentin at random. He had called Quentin \"a big rich\\nprick,\" and he had known Quentin was a golf pro. Well, Andy and his wife had\\n\\nbeen going out to that country club for drinks and dinner once or twice a week\\nfor a couple of years, and Andy had done a considerable amount of drinking there\\nonce he found out about his wifes affair. There was a marina with the country\\nclub, and for awhile in 1947 there had been a part-time grease-and-gas jockey\\n\\nworking there who matched Tommys description of Elwood Blatch. A big tall man,\\nmostly bald, with deep-set green eyes. A man who had an unpleasant way of\\nlooking at you, as though he was sizing you up. He wasnt there long, Andy \\nsaid.\\n\\nEither he quit or Briggs, the fellow in charge of the marina, fired him. But he\\nwasnt a man you forgot. He was too striking for that.\\n\\n\\nSo Andy went to see Warden Norton on a rainy, windy day with big gray clouds\\nscudding across the sky above the gray walls, a day when the last of the snow\\nwas starting to melt away and show lifeless patches of last years grass in the\\nfields beyond the prison.\\n\\nThe warden has a good-sized office in the Administration Wing, and behind the\\nwardens desk theres a door which connects with the assistant wardens \\noffice..\\n\\nThe assistant warden was out that day, but a trusty was there. He was a\\n\\nhalf-lame fellow whose real name I have forgotten; all the inmates, me included,\\ncalled him Chester, after Marshal Dillons sidekick. Chester was supposed to be\\nwatering the plants and waxing the floor. My guess is that the plants went\\n\\nthirsty that day and the only waxing that was done happened because of Chesters\\ndirty ear polishing the keyhole plate of that connecting door.\\n\\nHe heard the wardens main door open and close and then Norton saying: \"Good\\nmorning, Dufresne, how can I help you?\"\\n\\n\"Warden,\" Andy began, and old Chester told us that he could hardly recognize\\nAndys voice it was so changed. \"Warden. . . theres something . . . somethings\\nhappened to me thats . . . thats so . . . so . . . I hardly know where to\\n\\nbegin.\"\\n\\n\"Well, why dont you just begin at the beginning?\" the warden said, probably in\\nhis sweetest lets-all-turn-to- the-Twenty-third- Psalm-and-read-in-unison\\nvoice. \"That usually works the best.\"\\n\\nAnd so Andy did. He began by refreshing Norton on the details of the crime he\\n\\nhad been imprisoned for. Then he told the warden exactly what Tommy Williams had\\ntold him. He also gave out Tommys name, which you may think wasnt so wise in\\nlight of later developments, but Id just ask you what else he could have done,\\n\\nif his story was to have any credibility at all.\\n\\nWhen he had finished, Norton was completely silent for some time. I can just see\\nhim, probably tipped back in his office chair under the picture of Governor Reed\\nhanging on the wall, his fingers steepled, his liver lips pursed, his brow\\n\\nwrinkled into ladder rungs halfway to the crown of his head, his thirty-year pin\\ngleaming mellowly.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he said finally. \"Thats the damnedest story I ever heard. But Ill tell\\nyou what surprises me most about it, Dufresne.\"\\n\\n\"Whats that, sir?\"\\n\\n\"That you were taken in by it.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Sir? I dont understand what you mean.\" And Chester said that Andy Dufresne,\\nwho had faced down Byron Hadley on the plate-shop roof thirteen years before, \\nwas\\nalmost floundering for words.\\n\\n\"Well, now,\" Norton said. \"Its pretty obvious to me that this young fellow  \\nWilliams is\\nimpressed with you. Quite taken with you, as a matter of fact. He hears your \\ntale of woe,\\nand its quite natural of him to want to . . . cheer you up, lets say. Quite \\nnatural. Hes a\\nyoung man, not terribly bright. Not surprising he didnt realize what a state \\nit would put\\nyou into. Now what I suggest is-\"\\n\\n\"Dont you think I thought of that?\" Andy asked. \"But Id never told Tommy \\nabout\\n\\nthe man working down at the marina. I never told anyone that-it never even \\ncrossed my\\nmind! But Tommys description of his cellmate and that man . . . theyre \\nidentical!\"\\n\\n\"Well, now, you may be indulging in a little selective perception there,\" \\nNorton\\n\\nsaid with a chuckle. Phrases like that, selective perception, are required \\nlearning for people\\nin the penology and corrections business, and they use them all they can.\\n\\n\"Thats not it at all. Sir.\"\\n\\n\"Thats your slant on it,\" Norton said, \"but mine differs. And lets remember \\nthat I have\\nonly your word that there was such a man working at the Falmouth Hills Country \\nClub\\nback then.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" Andy broke in again. \"No, that isnt true. Because-\"\\n\\n\"Anyway,\" Norton overrode him, expansive and loud, \"lets just look at it from \\nthe other\\nend of the telescope, shall we? Suppose- just suppose, now-that there really \\nwas a fellow\\nnamed Elwood Blotch. \"\\n\\n\"Blatch,\" Andy said tightly.\\n\\n\"Blatch, by all means. And lets say he was Thomas Williams cellmate in Rhode \\nIsland.\\nThe chances are excellent that he has been released by now. Excellent. Why, we \\ndont even\\nknow how much time he might have done there before he ended up with Williams, \\ndo we?\\nOnly that he was doing a six-to-twelve.\"\\n\\n\"No. We dont know how much time hed done. But Tommy said he was a bad actor, a\\ncut-up. I think theres a fair chance that he may still be in. Even if hes \\nbeen released, the\\nprison will have a record of his last known address, the names of his \\nrelatives-\"\\n\\n\"And both would almost certainly be dead ends.\"\\n\\nAndy was silent for a moment, and then he burst out: \"Well, its a chance, \\nisnt it?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, of course it is. So just for a moment, Dufresne, lets assume that Blatch \\nexists and\\nthat he is still safely ensconced in the Rhode Island State Penitentiary. Now \\nwhat is he\\ngoing to say if we bring this kettle of fish to him in a bucket? Is he going to \\nfall down on\\nhis knees, roll his eyes, and say: I did it! I did it! By all means add a life \\nterm onto my\\ncharge!?\"\\n\\n\"How can you be so obtuse?\" Andy said, so low that Chester could barely hear. \\nBut he\\nheard the warden just fine.\\n\\n\"What? What did you call me?\"\\n\"Obtuse.\" Andy cried. \"Is it deliberate?\"\\n\\n\"Dufresne, youve taken five minutes of my time-no, seven- and I have a very \\nbusy\\nschedule today. So I believe well just declare this little meeting closed \\nand-\"\\n\\n\"The country club will have all the old time-cards, dont you realize that?\" \\nAndy shouted.\\n\"Theyll have tax-forms and W-twos and unemployment compensation forms, all \\nwith his\\nname on them! There will be employees there now that were there then, maybe \\nBriggs\\nhimself!  Its been fifteen years, not forever! Theyll remember him! They will \\nremember\\nBlatch. If Ive got Tommy to testify to what Blatch told him, and Briggs to \\ntestify that\\nBlatch was there, actually working at the country club, I can get a new trial! \\nI can-\"\\n\\n\"Guard! Guard. Take this man away!\"\\n\\n\"Whats the matter with you?\" Andy said, and Chester told me he was very nearly\\nscreaming by then. \"Its my life, my chance to get out, dont you see that? And \\n you wont\\nmake    a single long-distance call to at least verify Tommys story? Listen, \\nIll pay for the\\ncall! Ill pay for-\"\\n\\nThen there was a sound of thrashing as the guards grabbed him and started to \\ndrag him\\nout.\\n\\n\"Solitary,\" Warden Norton said dryly. He was probably fingering his thirty-year \\npin as he\\nsaid it. \"Bread and water.\"\\n\\nAnd so they dragged Andy away, totally out of control now, still screaming at \\nthe warden;\\nChester said you could hear him even after the door was shut: \"its my life! \\nIts my life,\\ndont   you understand its my life? \"\\n\\nTwenty days on the grain and drain train for Andy down there in solitary. It \\nwas his\\nsecond jolt in solitary, and his dust-up with Norton was his first real black \\nmark since he\\nhad joined our happy little family.\\n\\nIll tell you a little bit about Shawshanks solitary while were on the \\nsubject. Its something\\nof a throwback to those hardy pioneer days of the early to mid-1700s in Maine. \\nIn those\\n\\n\\ndays no one wasted much time with such things as \"penology\" and rehabilitation\" \\nand\\n\"selective perception.\" In those days, you were taken care of in terms of \\nabsolute black\\nand    white. You were either guilty  or innocent. If you were guilty, you were \\neither hung or\\nput in jail. And if you were sentenced to jail, you did not go to an \\ninstitution. No, you dug\\nyour own jail with a spade provided by the Province of Maine. You dug it as \\nwide and as\\ndeep as you could during the period between sunup and sundown. Then they gave \\nyou a\\ncouple of skins and a bucket, and down you went. Once down, the gazer would bar \\nthe\\ntop     of your hole, throw down some grain or maybe a piece of maggoty meat \\nonce or twice\\na week, and maybe there would be a dipperful of  barley soup on Sunday night. \\nYou\\npissed in the bucket, and you held up the same bucket for water when the gazer \\ncame\\naround  at six in the morning. When it rained, you used the bucket to bail out \\nyour jail-cell\\n\\n. . . unless, that is, you wanted to drown like a rat in a rain barrel.\\n\\nNo one spent a long time \"in the hole,\" as it was called; thirty months was an \\nunusually\\nlong term, and so far as Ive been able to tell, the longest term ever spent \\nfrom which an\\ninmate actually emerged alive was served by the so-called \"Durham Boy,\" a \\nfourteen-year-\\nold psychopath who castrated a schoolmate with a piece of rusty metal. He did \\nseven\\nyears, but of course he went in young and strong.\\n\\nYou have to remember that for a crime that was more serious than petty theft or\\nblasphemy or forgetting to put a snot rag in your pocket when out of doors on \\nthe\\nSabbath,      you were hung. For low crimes such as those just mentioned and \\nfor others like\\nthem, youd do your three or six or nine months in the hole and come out \\nfishbelly white,\\ncringing from the wide-open spaces, your eyes half blind, your teeth more than \\nlikely\\nrocking and rolling in their sockets from the scurvy, your feet crawling with \\nfungus. Jolly\\nold Province of Maine. Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.\\n\\nShawshanks Solitary Wing was nowhere as bad as that . . . I guess. Things come \\nin three\\nmajor degrees in the human experience, I think. Theres good, bad, and \\nterrible. And as\\nyou go down into progressive darkness toward terrible, it gets harder and \\nharder to make\\nsubdivisions.\\n\\nTo get to Solitary Wing you were led down twenty-three steps to a basement \\nlevel where\\nthe only sound was the drip of water. The only light was supplied by a series \\nof dangling\\nsixty-watt bulbs. The cells were keg-shaped, like those wall-safes rich people \\nsometimes\\nhide behind a picture. Like a safe, the round doorways were hinged, and solid \\ninstead of\\nbarred. You got ventilation from above, but no light except for your own \\nsixty-watt bulb,\\nwhich was turned off from a master-switch promptly at 8:00 P.M., an hour before \\nlights-\\nout in the rest of the prison. The light bulb wasnt in a wire mesh cage or \\nanything like\\nthat. The feeling was that if you wanted to exist down there in the dark, you \\nwere\\nwelcome to it. Not many did . . . but after eight, of course, you had no \\nchoice. You had a\\nbunk bolted to the wall and a can with no toilet seat. You had three ways to \\nspend your\\ntime: sitting, shitting, or sleeping. Big choice.\\n\\nTwenty days could get to seem like a year. Thirty days could seem like two, and \\nforty\\n\\n\\ndays like ten. Sometimes you could hear rats in the ventilation system. In a \\nsituation like\\nthat, subdivisions of terrible tend to get lost.\\n\\nIf anything at all can be said in favor of solitary, its just that you get \\ntime to think. Andy\\nhad twenty days in which to think while he enjoyed his grain and drain, and \\nwhen he got\\nout he requested another meeting with the warden. Request denied. Such a \\nmeeting, the\\nwarden told him, would be \"counter-productive.\" Thats another of those phrases \\nyou have\\nto master before you can go to work in the prisons and corrections held.\\n\\nPatiently, Andy renewed his request. And renewed it. And renewed it. He had \\nchanged,\\nhad Andy Dufresne. Suddenly, as that spring of 1963 bloomed around us, there \\nwere lines\\nin his face and sprigs of gray showing in his hair. He had lost that little \\ntrace of a smile that\\nalways seemed to linger around his mouth. His eyes stared out into space more \\noften, and\\nyou get to know that when a man stares that way, he is counting up the years \\nserved, the\\nmonths, the weeks, the days.\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\nHe renewed his request and renewed it. He was patient. He had nothing but time. \\nIt got to\\nbe summer. In Washington, President Kennedy was promising a fresh assault on \\npoverty\\nand on civil rights inequalities, not knowing he had only half a year to live. \\nIn Liverpool, a\\nmusical group called The Beatles was emerging as a force to be reckoned with in \\nBritish\\nmusic, but I guess that no one Stateside had yet heard of them. The Boston Red \\nSox, still\\nfour years away from what New England folks call The Miracle of 67, were \\nlanguishing in\\nthe cellar of the American League. All of those things were going on out in a \\nlarger world\\nwhere people walked free.\\n\\nNorton saw him near the end of June, and this conversation I heard about from \\nAndy\\nhimself some seven years later.\\n\\n\"If its the squeeze, you dont have to worry,\" Andy told Norton in a low \\nvoice. \"Do you\\nthink Id talk that up? Id be cutting my own throat. Id be just as indictable \\nas -- \"\\n\\n\"Thats enough,\" Norton interrupted. His face was as long and cold as a slate \\ngravestone.\\nHe leaned back in his office chair until the back of his head almost touched \\nthe sampler\\nreading    HIS JUDGMENT COMETH AND THAT RIGHT EARLY.\\n\\n\"But-\"\\n\\n\"Dont you ever mention money to me again,\" Norton said. \"Not in this office, \\nnot\\nanywhere. Not unless you want to see that library turned back into a storage \\nroom and\\npaint-locker again. Do you understand?\"\\n\\n\"I was trying to set your mind at ease, thats all.\"\\n\\n\"Well, now, when I need a sorry son of a bitch like you to set my mind at ease, \\nIll retire. I\\nagreed to this appointment because I got tired of being pestered, Dufresne. I \\nwant it to\\nstop. If you want to buy this particular Brooklyn Bridge, thats your affair. \\nDont make it\\nmine. I could hear crazy stories like yours twice a week if I wanted to lay \\nmyself open to\\nthem. Every sinner in this place would be using me for a crying towel. I had \\nmore respect\\nfor you. But this is the end. The end. Have we got an understanding?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" Andy said. \"But Ill be hiring a lawyer, you know.\"\\n\"What in Gods name for?\"\\n\\n\"I think we can put it together,\" Andy said. \"With Tommy Williams and with my\\ntestimony and corroborative testimony from records and employees at the country \\nclub, I\\nthink we can put it together. \"\\n\\n\"Tommy Williams is no longer an inmate of this facility.\"\\n\"What?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Hes been transferred.\"\\n\"Transferred where?\"\\n\"Cashman.   \"\\n\\nAt that, Andy fell silent. He was an intelligent man, but it would have taken an\\nextraordinarily stupid man not to smell deal all over that. Cashman was a \\nminimum-\\nsecurity          prison far up north in Aroostook County. The inmates pick a \\nlot of potatoes, and\\nthats hard work, but they are paid a decent wage for their labor and they can \\nattend\\nclasses  at CVI, a pretty decent vocational-technical institute, if they so \\ndesire. More\\nimportant to a fellow like Tommy, a fellow with a young wife and a child, \\nCashman had a\\nfurlough program . . . which meant a chance to live like a normal man, at least \\non the\\nweekends. A chance to build a model plane with his kid, have sex with his wife, \\nmaybe go\\non         a picnic.\\n\\nNorton had almost surely dangled all of that under Tommys nose with only one\\nstring attached: not one more word about Elwood Blatch, not now, not ever. Or\\nyoull end up doing hard time in Thomaston down there on scenic Route 1 with the\\nreal hard guys, and instead of having sex with your wife youll be having it\\n\\nwith some old bull queer.\\n\\n\"But why?\" Andy said. \"Why would-\"\\n\\n\"As a favor to you,\" Norton said calmly, \"I checked with Rhode Island. They did\\nhave an inmate named Elwood Blatch. He was given what they call a PP-provisional\\nparole, another one of these crazy liberal programs to put criminals out on the\\nstreets. Hes since disappeared. \"\\n\\nAndy said: \"The warden down there . . . is he a friend of yours?\"\\n\\nSam Norton gave Andy a smile as cold as a deacons watch chain. \"We are\\nacquainted,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Why?\" Andy repeated. \"Cant you tell me why you did it? You knew I wasnt going\\nto talk about . . . about anything you might have had going. You knew that. So\\nwhy?\"\\n\\n\"Because people like you make me sick,\" Norton said deliberately. \"I like you\\n\\nright where you are, Mr. Dufresne, and as long as I am warden here at Shawshank,\\nyou are going to be right here. You see, you used to think that you were better\\nthan anyone else. I have gotten pretty good at seeing that on a mans face. I\\nmarked   it on yours the first time I walked into the library. It might as well\\n\\nhave been written on your forehead in capital letters. That look is gone now,\\n\\n\\nand I like that just fine. It is not just that you are a useful vessel, never\\n\\nthink that. It is simply that men like you need to learn humility. Why, you used\\nto walk around that exercise yard as if it was a living room and you were at one\\nof those cocktail parties where the hellbound walk around coveting each others\\nwives and husbands and getting swinishly drunk. But you dont walk around that\\nway anymore. And Ill be watching to see if you should start to walk that way\\nagain. Over a period of years, Ill be watching you ,with great pleasure. Now\\n\\nget the hell out of here.\"\\n\\n\"Okay. But all the extracurricular activities stop now, Norton The investment\\ncounseling, the scams, the free tax advice. It all stops. Get H and R Block to\\ntell       you how to declare your income.\\n\\nWarden Nortons face first went brick-red . . . and then all the color fell out\\nof it. \"Youre going back into solitary for that. Thirty days. Bread and water.\\n\\nAnother black mark. And while youre in think about this: if anything thats\\nbeen going on should stop, the library goes. I will make it my personal \\nbusiness\\n\\nto see that it got back to what it was before you came here. And I will make you\\nlife . . . very hard. Very difficult. Youll do the hardest time it possible to\\n\\ndo. Youll lose that one-bunk Hilton down in Cellblock Five, for starters, and\\nyoull lose those rocks on the windowsill, an youll lose any protection the\\nguards have given you against the sodomites. You will . . . lose everything.\\n\\nClear?\"\\n\\nI guess it was clear enough.\\n\\nXI\\n\\n\\nTime continued to pass-the oldest trick in the world, an maybe the only one that\\nreally is magic. But Andy Dufresne ha changed. He had grown harder. Thats the\\nonly way I can think ( to put it. He went on doing Warden Nortons dirty work\\nand F held onto the library, so outwardly things were about the same. H\\ncontinued to have his birthday drinks and his year-end holiday drinks; he\\ncontinued        to share out the rest of each bottle. I got his fresh rock \\npolishing\\ncloths      from time to time, and in 1967 I g him a new rock-hammer-the one Id\\ngotten him nineteen yea ago had, as I told you, plumb worn out. Nineteen \\nyears.\\n\\nWhen you say it sudden like that, those three syllables sound like the thud and\\ndouble locking of a tomb door. The rock-hammer, which had bee a ten dollar item\\nback then, went for twenty-two by 67. He and had a sad little grin over that.\\n\\nAndy continued to shape and polish the rocks he found in the exercise yard, but\\nthe yard was smaller by then; half of what he been there in 1950 had been\\nasphalted over in 1962. Nonetheless he found enough to keep him occupied, I\\nguess. When he hi finished with each rock he would put it carefully on his winds\\nledge, which faced east. He told me he liked to look at them in the sun, the\\npieces   of the planet he had taken up from the dirt and shaped. Schists,\\n\\nquartzes, granites. Funny little mica-sculptures that were held together with\\nairplane glue. Various sedimentary conglomerates that were polished and cut in\\nsuch       a way that you could see why Andy called them \"millennium \\nsandwiches\"-the\\nlayers of different material that had built up over a period of decades and\\ncenturies.\\n\\nAndy would give his stones and his rock-sculptures away from time to time in\\norder to make room for new ones. He gave me the greatest number, I\\n\\nthink-counting the stones that looked like matched cufflinks, I had five. There\\nwas one of the mica sculptures I told you about, carefully crafted to look like \\na\\nman throwing a javelin, and two of the sedimentary conglomerates, all the levels\\nshowing in smoothly polished cross-section. Ive still got them, and I take \\nthem\\n\\ndown every so often and think about what a man can do, if he has time enough and\\nthe will to use it, a drop at a time.\\n\\nSo, on the outside, at least, things were about the same. If Norton had wanted\\nto break Andy as badly as he had said, he would have had to look below the\\nsurface to see the change. But if he had seen how different Andy had become, I\\nthink Norton would have been well-satisfied with the four years following his\\nclash with Andy.\\n\\nHe had told Andy that Andy walked around the exercise yard as if he were at a\\ncocktail party. That isnt the way I would have put it, but I know what he\\nmeant. It goes back to what I said about Andy wearing his freedom like an\\ninvisible coat, about how he never really developed a prison mentality. His \\neyes\\n\\nnever got that dull look. He never developed the walk that men get when the day\\nis over and they are going back to their cells for another endless night-that\\n\\n\\nflat-footed, hump-shouldered walk. Andy walked with his shoulders squared, and\\nhis step was always light, as if he were heading home to a good home-cooked meal\\nand a good woman instead of to a tasteless mess of soggy vegetables, lumpy\\nmashed potato, and a slice or two of that fatty, gristly stuff most of the cons\\n\\ncalled mystery meat . . . that, and a picture of Raquel Welch on the wall.\\n\\nBut for those four years, although he never became exactly like the Others he\\n\\ndid become silent, introspective, and brooding. Who could blame him? So maybe it\\nwas Warden Norton who was pleased . . . at least, for awhile.\\n\\nHis dark mood broke around the time of the 1967 World Series. That was the dream\\nyear, the year the Red Sox won the pennant instead of placing ninth, as the Las\\n\\nVegas bookies had predicted. When it happened-when they won the American League\\npennant -a kind of ebullience engulfed the whole prison. There was a goofy sort\\n\\nof feeling that if the Dead Sox could come to life, then maybe anybody could do\\nit. I cant explain that feeling now, any more than an ex-Beatlemaniac could\\nexplain that madness, I suppose. But it was real. Every radio in the place was\\n\\ntuned to the games as the Red Sox pounded down the stretch. There was gloom when\\nthe Sox dropped a pair in Cleveland near the end, and a nearly riotous joy when\\n\\nRico Petrocelli put away the pop fly that clinched it. And then there was the\\n\\ngloom that came when Lonborg was beaten in the seventh game of the Series to end\\nthe dream just sort of complete fruition. It probably pleased Norton to no end,\\n\\nthe son of a bitch. He liked his prison wearing sackcloth and ashes.\\n\\nBut for Andy, there was no tumble back down into gloom. He wasnt much of a\\nbaseball fan anyway, and maybe that was why. Nevertheless, he seemed to have\\ncaught the current of good feeling, and for him it didnt peter out again after\\n\\nthe last game of the Series. He had taken that invisible coat out of the closet\\nand put it on again.\\n\\nI remember one bright-gold fall day in very late October, a couple of weeks\\nafter the World Series had ended. It must have been a Sunday, because the\\nexercise yard was full of men \"walking off the week\"-tossing a Frisbee or two,\\npassing around a football, bartering what they had to barter. Others would be at\\nthe long table in the Visitors Hall, under the watchful eyes of the screws,\\ntalking with their relatives, smoking cigarettes, telling sincere lies,\\n\\nreceiving their picked-over care-packages.\\n\\nAndy was squatting Indian fashion against the wall, chunking two small rocks\\ntogether in his hands, his face turned up into the sunlight. It was surprisingly\\nwarm, that sun, for a day so late in the year.\\n\\n\"Hello, Red,\" he called. \"Come on and sit a spell.\"\\nI did.\\n\\n\\n\"You want this?\" he asked, and handed me one of the two carefully polished\\n\"millennium sandwiches\" I just told you about\\n\\n\"I sure do,\" I said. \"Its very pretty. Thank you.\"\\n\\nHe shrugged and changed the subject. \"Big anniversary coming up for you next\\nyear.\"\\n\\nI nodded. Next year would make me a thirty-year man. Sixty per cent of my life\\nspent in Shawshank State Prison.\\n\\n\"Think youll ever get out?\"\\n\\n\"Sure. When I have a long white beard and just about three be marbles left\\nrolling around upstairs.\"\\n\\nHe smiled a little and then turned his face up into the sun again, his eyes\\nclosed. \"Feels good.\"\\n\\n\"I think it always does when you know the damn winters almost right on top of\\nyou.\"\\n\\nHe nodded, and we were silent for awhile.\\n\\n\"When I get out of here,\" Andy said finally, \"Im going where its warm all the\\ntime.\" He spoke with such calm assurance you would have thought he had only a\\nmonth or so left to serve. \"You know where Im goin, Red?\"\\n\\n\"Nope. \"\\n\\n\"Zihuatanejo,\" he said, rolling the word softly from his tongue like music.\\n\"Down in Mexico. Its a little place maybe twenty miles from Playa Azul and\\n\\nMexico Highway Thirty-seven. Its a hundred miles northwest of Acapulco on the\\nPacific Ocean. You know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific?\"\\n\\nI told him I didnt.\\n\\n\"They say it has no memory. And thats where I want to finish out my life, Red.\\nIn a warm place that has no memory.\"\\n\\nHe had picked up a handful of pebbles as he spoke; now he tossed them, one by\\none, and watched them bounce and roll across the baseball diamonds dirt\\ninfield, which would be under a foot of snow before long.\\n\\n\"Zihuatanejo. Im going to have a little hotel down there. Six cabanas along the\\nbeach, and six more set further back, for the highway trade. 111 have a guy\\n\\n\\nwholl take my guests out charter fishing. Therell be a trophy for the guy who\\ncatches the biggest marlin of the season, and Ill put his picture up in the\\nlobby. It wont be a family place. Itll be a place for people on their\\nhoneymoons first or second varieties.\"\\n\\n\"And where are you going to get the money to buy this fabulous place?\" I asked\\n\"Your stock account?\"\\n\\nHe looked at me and smiled. \"Thats not so far wrong,\" he said. \"Sometimes you\\nstartle me, Red.\"\\n\\n\"What are you talking about?\"\\n\\n\"There are really only two types of men in the world when it comes to bad\\ntrouble,\" Andy said, cupping a match between his hands and lighting a \\ncigarette.\\n\\n\"Suppose there was a house full of rare paintings and sculptures and fine old\\nantiques, Red? And suppose the guy who owned the house heard that there was a\\nmonster of a hurricane headed right at it? One of those two kinds of men just\\nhopes    for the best. The hurricane will change course, he says to himself. No\\n\\nright-thinking hurricane would ever dare wipe out all these Rembrandts, my two\\nDegas horses, my Grant Woods, and my Bentons. Furthermore, God wouldnt allow\\nit. And if worse comes to worst, theyre insured. Thats one sort of man. The\\n\\nother sort just assumes that hurricane is going to tear right through the middle\\nof his house. If the weather bureau says the hurricane just changed course, this\\nguy assumes itll change back in order to put his house on ground-zero again.\\nThis second type of guy knows theres no harm in hoping for the best as long as\\nyoure prepared for the worst.\"\\n\\nI lit a cigarette of my own. \"Are you saying you prepared for the eventuality? \\n\"\\n\\n\"Yes. I prepared for the hurricane. I knew how bad it looked. I didnt have much\\ntime, but in the time I had, I operated. I had a friend-just about the only\\n\\nperson who stood by me-who worked for an investment company in Portland. He died\\nabout six years ago. \"\\n\\n\"Sorry. \"\\n\\n“Yeah.” Andy tossed his butt away. \"Linda and I had about fourteen thousand\\ndollars. Not a big bundle, but hell, we were young. We had our whole lives ahead\\nof us.\" He grimaced a little, then laughed. \"When the shit hit the fan, I\\n\\nstarted lugging my Rembrandts out of the path of the hurricane. I sold my stocks\\nand paid the capital gains tax just like a good little boy. Declared \\neverything.\\n\\nDidnt cut any corners.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Didnt they freeze your estate?\"\\n\\n\"I was charged with murder, Red, not dead! You cant freeze the assets of an\\ninnocent man-thank God. And it was awhile before they even got brave enough to\\ncharge me with the crime. Jim-my friend-and I, we had some time. I got hit\\n\\npretty good, just dumping everything like that. Got my nose skinned. But at the\\ntime I had worse things to worry about than a small skinning on the stock\\nmarket.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, Id say you did.\"\\n\\n\"But when I came to Shawshank it was all safe. Its still safe. Outside these\\nwalls, Red, theres a man that no living soul has ever seen face to face. He has\\na Social Security card and a Maine drivers license. Hes got a birth\\ncertificate. Name of Peter Stevens. Nice, anonymous name, huh?\"\\n\\n\"Who is he?\" I asked. I thought I knew what he was going to say, but I couldnt\\nbelieve it.\\n\\n\"Me. \"\\n\\n\"Youre not going to tell me that you had time to set up a false identity while\\nthe bulls were sweating you,\" I said, \"or that you finished the job while you\\nwere on trial for-\"\\n\\n\"No, Im not going to tell you that. My friend Jim was the one who set up the\\nfalse identity. He started after my appeal was turned down, and the major pieces\\nof identification were in his hands by the spring of 1950.\"\\n\\n\"He must have been a pretty close friend,\" I said. I was not sure how much of\\nthis I believed a little, a lot, or none. But the day was warm and the sun was\\nout, and it was one hell of a good story. \"All of thats one hundred per cent\\nillegal, setting up a false ID like that. \"\\n\\n\"He was a close friend,\" Andy said. \"We were in the war together. France,\\nGermany, the occupation. He was a good friend.\\n\\nHe knew it was illegal, but he also knew that setting up a false identity in\\n\\nthis country is very easy and very safe. He took my money my money with all the\\ntaxes on it paid so the IRS wouldnt get too interested-and invested it for\\n\\nPeter Stevens. He did that in 1950 and 1951. Today it amounts to three hundred\\nand seventy thousand dollars, plus change.\"\\n\\nI guess my jaw made a thump when it dropped against my chest, because he \\nsmiled.\\n\\n\\n\"Think of all the things people wish theyd invested in since 1950 or so, and\\ntwo or three of them will be things Peter Stevens was into. If I hadnt ended up\\nin here, Id probably be worth seven or eight million bucks by now. Id have a\\nRolls . . . and probably an ulcer as big as a portable radio.\"\\n\\nHis hands went to the dirt and began sifting out more pebbles. They moved\\ngracefully, restlessly.\\n\\n\"It was hoping for the best and expecting the worst-nothing but that. The false\\nname was. just to keep what little capital I had untainted. It was lugging the\\npaintings out of the path of the hurricane. But I had no idea that the \\nhurricane\\n\\n. . . that it could go on as long as it has.\"\\n\\nI didnt say anything for awhile. I guess I was trying to absorb the idea that\\n\\nthis small, spare man in prison gray next to me could be worth more money than\\nWarden Norton would make in the rest of his miserable life, even with the scams\\nthrown in.\\n\\n\"When you said you could get a lawyer, you sure werent kidding,\" I said at\\n\\nlast. \"For that kind of dough you could have hired Clarence Darrow, or whoevers\\npassing for him these days. Why didnt you, Andy? Christ! You could have been\\nout of here like a rocket.\"\\n\\nHe smiled. It was the same smile that had been on his face when hed told me he\\nand his wife had had their whole lives ahead of them \"No,\" he said.\\n\\n\"A good lawyer would have sprung the Williams kid from Cashman whether he wanted\\nto go or not,\" I said. I was getting carried away now. \"You could have gotten\\n\\nyour new trial, hired private detectives to look for that guy Blatch, and blown\\nNorton out of the water to boot. Why not, Andy?\"\\n\\n\"Because I outsmarted myself. If I ever try to put my hands on Peter Stevenss\\nmoney from inside here, Ill lose every cent of it. My friend Jim could have\\narranged it, but Jims dead. You see the problem? \"\\n\\nI saw it. For all the good that money could do Andy, it might as well have\\nreally belonged to another person. In a way, it did. And if the stuff it was\\n\\ninvested in suddenly turned bad, all Andy could do would be to watch the plunge,\\nto trace it day after day on the stocks and-bonds page of the Press-Herald. \\nIts\\n\\na tough life if you dont weaken, I guess.\\n\\n\"Ill tell you how it is, Red. Theres a big hayfield in the town of Buxton. You\\nknow where Buxton is at, dont you?\"\\n\\nI said I did. It lies right next door to Scarborough.\\n\\n\\n\"Thats right. And at the north end of this particular hayfield theres a rock\\nwall, right out of a Robert Frost poem. And somewhere along the base of that\\nwall is a rock that has no business in a Maine hayfield. Its a piece of\\n\\nvolcanic glass, and until 1947 it was a paperweight on my office desk. My friend\\nJim put it in that wall. Theres a key underneath it. The key opens a safe\\n\\ndeposit box in the Portland branch of the Casco Bank.\"\\n\\n\"I guess youre in a peck of trouble,\" I said. \"When your friend Jim died, the\\nIRS must have opened all of his safe deposit boxes. Along with the executor of\\nhis will, of course.\"\\n\\nAndy smiled and tapped the side of my head. \"Not bad. Theres more up there than\\nmarshmallows, I guess. But we took care of the possibility that Jim might die\\nwhile I was in the slam. The box is in the Peter Stevens name, and once a year\\n\\nthe firm of lawyers that served as Jims executors sends a check to the Casco to\\ncover the rental of the Stevens box.\\n\\n\"Peter Stevens is inside that box, just waiting to get out. His birth\\ncertificate, his Social Security card, and his drivers license. The license is\\nsix      years out of date because Jim died six years ago, true, but its still\\nperfectly renewable for a five-dollar fee. His stock certificates are there, the\\ntax-free municipals, and about eighteen bearer bonds in the amount of ten\\nthousand dollars each.\"\\n\\nI whistled.\\n\\n\"Peter Stevens is locked in a safe deposit box at the Casco Bank in Portland and\\nAndy Dufresne is locked in a safe deposit box at Shawshank,\" he said. \"Tit for\\ntat. And the key that unlocks the box and the money and the new life is under a\\nhunk of black glass in a Buxton hayfield. Told you this much, so Ill tell you\\nsomething else, Red-for the last twenty years, give or take, I have been\\n\\nwatching the papers with a more than usual interest for news of any construction\\nprojects in Buxton. I keep thinking that someday soon Im going to read that\\ntheyre putting a highway through there, or erecting a new community hospital,\\nor building a shopping center. Burying my new life under ten feet of concrete,\\n\\nor spitting it into a swamp somewhere with a big load of fill.\"\\n\\nI blurted, \"Jesus Christ, Andy, if all of this is true, how do you keep from\\ngoing crazy?\"\\n\\nHe smiled. \"So far, all quiet on the Western front.\"\\n\"But it could be years-\"\\n\\n\"It will be. But maybe not as many as the State and Warden Norton think its\\ngoing to be. I just cant afford to wait that long. I keep thinking about\\n\\n\\nZihuatanejo and that small hotel. Thats all I want from my life now, Red, and I\\ndont think thats too much to want. I didnt kill Glenn Quentin and I didnt\\n\\nkill my wife, and that hotel . . . its not too much to want. To swim and get a\\n\\ntan and sleep in a room with open windows and space . . . thats not too much to\\nwant.\"\\n\\nHe slung the stones away.\\n\\n\"You know, Red,\" he said in an offhand voice, \" a place like that . . . Id have\\nto have a man who knows how to get things.\"\\n\\nI thought about it for a long time. And the biggest drawback in my mind wasnt\\neven that we were talking pipedreams in a shitty little prison exercise yard\\n\\nwith armed guards looking down at us from their sentry posts. \"I couldnt do\\nit,\" I said. \"I couldnt get along on the outside. Im what they call an\\ninstitutional man now. In here Im the man who can get it for you, yeah. But \\nout\\n\\nthere, anyone can get it for you. Out there, if you want posters or rock hammers\\nor one particular record or a boat-in-a-bottle model kit, you can use the\\n\\nfucking Yellow Pages. In here, Im the fucking Yellow Pages. I wouldnt know how\\nto begin. Or where.\"\\n\\n\"You underestimate yourself,\" he said. \"Youre a self-educated man, a self-made\\nman. A rather remarkable man, I think.\"\\n\\n\"Hell, I dont even have a high school diploma.\"\\n\\n\"I know that,\" he said. \"But it isnt just a piece of paper that makes a man.\\nAnd it isnt just prison that breaks one, either.\"\\n\\n\"I couldnt hack it outside, Andy. I know that.\"\\n\\nHe got up. \"You think it over,\" he said casually, just as the inside whistle\\nblew. And he strolled off, as if he were a free man who had just made another\\n\\nfree man a proposition. And for awhile just that was enough to make melees free.\\nAndy could do that. He could make me forget for a time that we were both lifers,\\nat the mercy of a hard-ass parole board and a psalm-singing warden who liked\\nAndy Dufresne right where he was. After all, Andy was a lap-dog who could do\\ntax-returns. What a wonderful animal! But by that night in my cell I felt like a\\nprisoner again. The whole idea seemed absurd, and that mental image of blue\\nwater and white beaches seemed more cruel than foolish-it dragged at my brain\\nlike a fishhook. I just couldnt wear that invisible coat the way Andy did. I\\n\\nfell asleep that night and dreamed of a great glassy black stone in the middle\\nof a hayfield; a stone shaped like a giant blacksmiths anvil. I was trying to\\n\\nrock the stone up so I could get the key that was underneath. It wouldnt budge;\\nit was just too damned big. And in the background, but getting closer, I could\\n\\n\\nhear the baying of bloodhounds.\\n\\nXII\\n\\nWhich leads us, I guess, to the subject of jailbreaks. Sure, they happen from\\ntime to time in our happy little family. You dont go over the wall, though, not\\nat Shawshank, not if youre smart. The searchlight beams go all night, probing\\nlong white fingers across the open fields that surround the prison on three\\nsides and the stinking marshland on the fourth. Cons do go over the wall from\\ntime to time, and the searchlights almost always catch them. If not, they get\\n\\npicked up trying to thumb a ride on Highway 6 or Highway 99. If they try to cut\\nacross country, some farmer sees them and just phones the location in to the\\nprison. Cons who go over the wall are stupid cons. Shawshank is no Canon City,\\nbut in a rural area a man humping his ass across country in a gray pajama suit\\nsticks out like a cockroach on a wedding cake.\\n\\nOver the years, the guys who have done the best-maybe oddly, maybe not so\\noddly-are the guys who did it on the spur of the moment. Some of them have gone\\nout    in the middle of a cartful of sheets; a convict sandwich on white, you \\ncould\\nsay. There was a lot of that when I first came in here, but over the years they\\n\\nhave more or less closed that loophole.\\n\\nWarden Nortons famous \"Inside-Out\" program produced its share of escapees, too.\\nThey were the guys who decided they liked what lay to the right of the hyphen\\nbetter than what lay to the left. And again, in most cases it was a very casual\\n\\nkind of thing. Drop your blueberry rake and stroll into the bushes while one of\\nthe screws is having a glass of water at the truck or when a couple o~ them get\\ntoo involved in arguing over yards passing or rushing or the old Boston\\nPatriots.\\n\\nIn 1969, the Inside-Outers were picking potatoes in Sabbatus. It was the third\\nof November and the work was almost done. There was a guard named Henry\\nPugh - and he is no longer a member o our happy little family, believe me –\\nsitting on the back bumper of one of the potato trucks and having his lunch with\\nhis carbine across his knees when a beautiful (or so it was told to me, but\\nsometimes these things get exaggerated) ten-point buck strolled out of the cold\\nearly afternoon mist. Pugh went after it with visions of just how that trophy\\nwould look mounted in his rec room, and while he was doing it, three of his\\ncharges just walked away. Two were recaptured in a Lisbon Falls pinball parlor.\\n\\n\\nThe third has not beer found to this day.\\n\\nI suppose the most famous case of all was that of Sid Nedeau. This goes back to\\n1958, and I guess it will never be topped. Sid was out lining the ball field \\nfor\\n\\na Saturday intramural baseball game when the three oclock inside whistle blew,\\nsignaling the shift change for the guards. The parking lot is just beyond the\\nexercise yard, on the other side of the electrically operated main gate. At\\n\\nthree the gate opens and the guards coming on duty and those going off mingle.\\nTheres a lot of back-slapping and bullyragging, comparison of league bowling\\nscores and the usual number of tired old ethnic jokes.\\n\\nSid just trundled his lining machine right out through the gate, leaving a\\nthree-inch baseline all the way from home plate in the exercise yard to the\\n\\nditch on the far side of Route 6, where they found the machine overturned in a\\npile of lime. Dont ask me how he did it. He was dressed in his prison uniform,\\nhe stood six-feet-two, and he was billowing clouds of lime-dust behind him All I\\ncan figure is that, it being Friday afternoon and all, the guards going off \\nwere\\n\\nso happy to be going off, and the guards coming on were so downhearted to be\\ncoming on, that the members of the former group never got their heads out of the\\nclouds and those in the latter never got their noses off their shoe tops . . .\\n\\nand old Sid Nedeau just sort of slipped out between the two.\\n\\nSo far as I know, Sid is still at large. Over the years, Andy Dufresne and I \\nhad\\n\\na good many laughs over Sid Nedeaus great escape, and when we heard about that\\nairline hijacking for ransom, the one where the guy parachuted from the back\\n\\ndoor of the airplane, Andy swore up and down that D. B. Coopers real name was\\nSid Nedeau.\\n\\n\"And he probably had a pocketful of baseline lime in his pocket for good luck,\"\\nAndy said. \"That lucky son of a bitch.\"\\n\\nBut you should understand that a case like Sid Nedeau, or the fellow who got\\naway clean from the Sabbatus potato-field crew, guys like that are winning the\\nprison version of the Irish Sweepstakes. Purely a case of six different kinds of\\nluck somehow jelling together all at the same moment. A stiff like Andy could\\nwait ninety years and not get a similar break.\\n\\nMaybe you remember, a ways back, I mentioned a guy named Henley Backus, the\\nwashroom foreman in the laundry. He came to Shawshank in 1922 and died in the\\nprison infirmary thirty-one years later. Escapes and escape attempts were a\\n\\nhobby of his, maybe because he never quite dared to take the plunge himself. He\\ncould tell you a hundred different schemes, all of them crackpot, and all of\\n\\nthem had been tried in The Shank at one time or another. My favorite was the\\ntale of Beaver Morrison, a b&e convict who tried to build a glider from scratch\\nin the plate-factory basement. The plans he was working from were in a\\n\\n\\ncirca-1900 book called The Modern Boys Guide to Fan and Adventure. Beaver got\\nit built without being discovered, or so the story goes, only to discover there\\n\\nwas no door from the basement big enough to get the damned thing out. When\\nHenley told that story, you could bust a gut laughing, and he knew a dozen-no,\\ntwo dozen-almost as funny.\\n\\nWhen it came to detailing Shawshank bust-outs, Henley had it down chapter and\\nverse. He told me once that during his time there had been better than four\\nhundred escape attempts that he knew of. Really think about that for a moment\\nbefore you just nod your head and read on Four hundred escape attempts! That\\n\\ncomes out to 12.9 escape attempts for every year Henley Backus was in Shawshank\\nand keeping track of them. The Escape-Attempt-of-the-Month Club. Of course most\\nof them were pretty slipshod affairs, the sort of thing that ends up with a\\n\\nguard grabbing some poor, sidling slobs arm and growling, \"Where do you think\\nyoure going, you happy asshole?\"\\n\\nHenley said hed class maybe sixty of them as more serious attempts, and he\\nincluded the \"prison break\" of 1937, the year before I arrived at The Shank. The\\nnew Administration Wing was under construction then and fourteen cons got out,\\nusing construction equipment in a poorly locked shed. The whole of southern\\nMaine got into a panic over those fourteen \"hardened criminals,\" most of whom\\nwere scared to death and had no more idea of where they should go than a\\njackrabbit does when its headlight-pinned to the highway with a big truck\\n\\nbearing down on it. Not one of those fourteen got away. Two of them were shot\\ndead-by civilians, not police officers or prison personnel-but none got away.\\n\\nHow many had gotten away between 1938, when I came here, and that day in October\\nwhen Andy first mentioned Zihuatanejo to me? Putting my information and Henleys\\ntogether, Id say ten. Ten that got away clean. And although it isnt the kind\\n\\nof thing you can know for sure, Id guess that at least half of those ten are\\ndoing time in other institutions of lower learning like The Shank. Because you\\ndo get institutionalized. When you take away a mans freedom and teach him to\\nlive in a cell, he seems to lose his ability to think in dimensions Hes like\\n\\nthat jackrabbit I mentioned, frozen in the oncoming lights of the truck that is\\nbound to kill it. More often than not a con whos just out will pull some dumb\\njob that hasnt a chance in hell of succeeding . . . and why? Because itll get\\nhim back inside. Back where he understands how things work.\\n\\nAndy wasnt that way, but I was. The idea of seeing the Pacific sounded good,\\nbut I was afraid that actually being there would Scare me to death-the bigness\\nof it.\\n\\nAnyhow, the day of that conversation about Mexico, and about Mr. Peter Stevens \\n.\\n\\n. . that was the day I began to believe that Andy had some idea of doing a\\ndisappearing act. I hoped to God he would be careful if he did, and still, I\\nwouldnt        have bet money on his chances of succeeding. Warden Norton, you \\nsee,\\n\\n\\nwas watching Andy with a special close eye. Andy wasnt just another deadhead\\nwith a number to Norton; they had a working relationship, you might say. Also,\\nAndy had brains and he had heart. Norton was determined to use the one and crush\\nthe other.\\n\\nAs there are honest politicians on the outside-ones who stay bought-there are\\nhonest prison guards, and if you are a good judge of character and if you have\\nsome loot to spread around, I suppose its possible that you could buy enough\\nlook-the-other-way to make a break. Im not the man to tell you such a thing has\\nnever             been done, but Andy Dufresne wasnt the man who could do it. \\nBecause, as\\nIve said, Norton was watching. Andy knew it, and the screws knew it, too.\\n\\nNobody was going to nominate Andy for the Inside-Out program, not as long as\\nWarden Norton was evaluating the nominations. And Andy was not the kind of man\\nto   try a casual Sid Nedeau type of escape.\\n\\nIf I had been him, the thought of that key would have tormented me endlessly. I\\nwould have been lucky to get two hours worth of honest shut-eye a night. Buxton\\nwas less than thirty miles from Shawshank. So near and yet so far.\\n\\nI still thought his best chance was to engage a lawyer and try for the retrial.\\nAnything to get out from under Nortons thumb. Maybe Tommy Williams could be\\nshut  up by nothing more than a cushy furlough program, but I wasnt entirely\\n\\nsure. Maybe a good old Mississippi hard-ass lawyer could crack him . . . and\\nmaybe that lawyer wouldnt even have to work that hard. Williams had honestly\\nliked Andy. Every now and then Id bring these points up to Andy, who would only\\nsmile, his eyes far away, and say he was thinking about it.\\n\\nApparently hed been thinking about a lot of other things, as well.\\n\\nIn 1975, Andy Dufresne escaped from Shawshank. He hasnt been recaptured, and I\\ndont think he ever will be. In fact, I dont think Andy Dufresne even exists\\nanymore. But I think theres a man down in Zihuatanejo, Mexico, named Peter\\nStevens. Probably running a very new small hotel in this year of our Lord 1976.\\n\\nIll tell you what I know and what I think; thats about all I can do, isnt \\nit?\\n\\nOn March 12th, 1975, the cell doors in Cellblock 5 opened at 6:30 A.M., as they\\ndo every morning around here except Sunday. And as they do every day except\\nSunday, the inmates of those cells stepped forward into the corridor and formed\\ntwo lines as the cell doors slammed shut behind them. They walked up to the main\\ncellblock gate, where they were counted off by two guards before being sent on\\ndown    to the cafeteria for a breakfast of oatmeal, scrambled eggs, and fatty\\n\\nbacon.\\n\\n\\nAll of this went according to routine until the count at the cellblock gate.\\nThere should have been twenty-seven. Instead, there were twenty-six. After a\\ncall to the Captain of the Guards, Cellblock 5 was allowed to go to breakfast.\\n\\nThe Captain of the Guards, a not half-bad fellow named Richard Gonyar, and his\\nassistant, a jolly prick named Dave Burkes, came down to Cellblock 5 right away.\\nGonyar re-opened the cell doors and he and Burkes went down the corridor\\ntogether, dragging their sticks over the bars, their guns out. In a case like\\n\\nthat what you usually have is someone who has been taken sick in the night, so\\nsick he cant even step out of his cell in the morning. More rarely, someone has\\ndied . . . or committed suicide.\\n\\nBut this time, they found a mystery instead of a sick man or a dead man. They\\nfound no man at all. There were fourteen cells in Cellblock 5, seven to a side,\\nall fairly neat-restriction of visiting privileges is the penalty for a sloppy\\n\\ncell at Shawshank-and all very empty.\\n\\nGonyars first assumption was that there had been a miscount or a practical\\njoke. So instead of going off to work after breakfast, the inmates of Cellblock\\n5 were sent back to their cells, joking and happy. Any break in the routine was\\nalways welcome.\\n\\nCell doors opened; prisoners stepped in; cell doors closed. Some clown shouting,\\n\"I want my lawyer, I want my lawyer, you guys run this place just like a\\n\\nfrigging prison.\" Burkes: \"Shut up in there, or Ill rank you.\" The clown: \"I\\nranked your wife, Burkie.\" Gonyar: \"Shut up, all of you, or youll spend the day\\nin there.\"\\n\\nHe and Burkes went up the line again, counting noses. They didnt have to go\\nfar.\\n\\n\"Who belongs in this cell?\" Gonyar asked the rightside night guard.\\n\\n\"Andrew Dufresne,\" the rightside answered, and that was all it took. Everything\\nstopped being routine right then. The balloon went up.\\n\\nIn all the prison movies Ive seen, this wailing horn goes off when theres \\nbeen\\n\\na break. That never happens at Shawshank. The first thing Gonyar did was to get\\nin touch with the warden. The second thing was to get a search of the prison\\ngoing. The third was to alert the state police in Scarborough to the \\npossibility\\n\\nof a breakout.\\n\\nThat was the routine. It didnt call for them to search the suspected escapees\\n\\ncell, and so no one did. Not then. Why would they? It was a case of what you see\\nis what you get. It was a small square room, bars on the window and bars on the\\nsliding door. Rocks on the windowsill .\\n\\n\\nAnd the poster, of course. It was Linda Ronstadt by then. The poster was right\\nover his bunk. There had been a poster there, in that exact same place, for\\n\\ntwenty-six years. And when someone, who was Warden Norton himself, as it turned\\nout, poetic justice if there ever was anybody looked behind it, they got one\\n\\nhell of a shock.\\n\\nBut that didnt happen until six-thirty that night, almost twelve hours after\\n\\nAndy had been reported missing, probably twenty hours after he had actually made\\nhis escape.\\n\\nNorton hit the roof.\\n\\nI have it on good authority. Chester, the trusty, who was waxing the hall floor\\nin the Admin Wing that day. He didnt have to polish any keyplates with his ear\\nthat day; he said you could hear the warden clear down to Records & Files as he\\nchewed on Rich Gonyars ass.\\n\\n\"What do you mean, youre satisfied hes not on the prison grounds? What does\\nthat mean? It means you didnt find him! You better find him! You better!\\n\\nBecause I want him! Do you hear me? want him!\" Gonyar said something.\\n\"Didnt happen on your shift? Thats what you say. So far as I can tell, no one\\nknows when it happened. Or how. Or if it really did. Now, I want him in my\\noffice by three oclock this afternoon, or some heads are going to roll. I can\\npromise you that, and I always keep my promises.\"\\n\\nSomething else from Gonyar, something that seemed to provoke Norton to even\\ngreater rage.\\n\\n\"No? Then look at this! Look at this. You recognize it? Last nights tally for\\nCellblock Five. Every prisoner accounted for!  Dufresne was locked up last night\\nat   nine and it is impossible for him to be gone now!  It is impossible!  Now \\nyou\\nAnd him!\"\\n\\nBut at three that afternoon Andy was still among the missing. Norton himself\\nstormed down to Cellblock 5 a few hours later, where the rest of us had been\\nlocked up all of that day. Had we been questioned? We had spent most of that\\nlong day being questioned by harried screws who were feeling the breath of the\\ndragon on the backs of their necks. We all said the same thing: we had seen\\nnothing, heard nothing. And so far as I know, we were all telling the truth. I\\nknow that I was. All we could say was that Andy had indeed been in his cell at\\nthe time of the lock-in, and at lights-out an hour later.\\n\\nOne wit suggested that Andy had poured himself out through the keyhole. The\\n\\nsuggestion earned the guy four days in solitary They were uptight. So Norton \\ncame down.\\n\\n\\nHe stalked down glaring at us with blue eyes nearly hot  enough to strike \\nsparks from the\\ntempered steel bar of our cages. He looked at us as if he believed we were all \\nin on it\\nProbably he did believe it.\\n\\nHe went into Andys cell and looked around. It was just as Andy had left it, the\\nsheets on his bunk turned back but without looking slept-in. Rocks on the\\nwindowsill . . . but not all of them. The ones he liked best he took with him.\\n\\n\"Rocks,\" Norton hissed, and swept them off the window ledge with a clatter.\\nGonyar, who was now on overtime, winced but said nothing .\\n\\nNortons eyes fell on the Linda Ronstadt poster. Linda was looking back over her\\nshoulder, her hands tucked into the back pockets of a very tight pair of\\n\\nfawn-colored slacks. She was wearing a halter and she had a deep California \\ntan.\\n\\nIt must have offended the hell out of Nortons Baptist sensibilities, that\\nposter.\\n\\nWatching him glare at it, I remembered what Andy had once said about feeling he\\ncould almost step through the picture and be with the girl.\\n\\nIn a very real way, that was exactly what he did, as Norton was only seconds\\nfrom discovering.\\n\\n\"Wretched thing!\" he grunted, and ripped the poster from the wall with a single\\nswipe of his hand. And revealed the gaping, crumbled hole in the concrete behind\\nit    .\\n\\nGonyar wouldnt go in.\\n\\nNorton ordered him. God, they must have heard Norton ordering Rich Gonyar to go\\nin there all over the prison, and Gonyar just refused him, point blank.\\n\\n\"Ill have your job for this!\" Norton screamed. He was as hysterical as a woman\\nhaving a hot-flash. He had utterly blown his cool. His neck had turned a rich,\\ndark   red, and two veins stood out, throbbing, on his forehead. \"You can count \\non\\nit, you . . . you Frenchman! Ill have your job and Ill see to it that you\\n\\nnever get another one in any prison system in New England!\"\\n\\nGonyar silently held out his service pistol to Norton, butt first. Hed had \\nenough. He was\\nthen two hours overtime, going on three, and hed just had enough. It was as if \\nAndys\\ndefection from our happy little family had driven Norton right over the edge of \\nsome\\nprivate irrationality that had been there for a long time. . .\\n\\nI dont know what that private irrationality might have been, of course. But I\\ndo know that there were twenty-six cons listening to Norton s little dust-up\\n\\n\\nwith Rich Gonyar that evening as the last of the light faded from a dull\\nlate-winter sky, all of us hard-timers and long-line riders who had seen the\\n\\nadministrators come and go, the hard-asses and the candy-asses alike, and we all\\nknew that Warden Samuel Norton had just passed what the engineers like to call\\n\"the breaking strain.\"\\n\\nAnd by God, it almost seemed to me that somewhere I could hear Andy Dufresne\\nlaughing.\\n\\nNorton finally got a skinny drink of water on the night shift to go into the\\n\\nhole that had been behind Andys poster of Linda Ronstadt. The skinny guards\\nname was Rory Tremont, and he was not exactly a ball of fire in the brains\\ndepartment. Maybe he thought he was going to win a Bronze Star or something. As\\nit    turned out, it was fortunate that Norton got someone of Andys approximate\\nheight and build to go in there; if they had sent a big-assed fellow, as most\\n\\nprison guards seem to be, the guy would have stuck in there as sure as God made\\ngreen grass . . . and he might be there still.\\n\\nTremont went in with a nylon filament rope, which someone had found in the trunk\\nof his car, tied around his waist and a big six-battery flashlight in one hand.\\n\\nBy then Gonyar, who had changed his mind about quitting and who seemed to be the\\nonly one there still able to think clearly, had dug out a set of blueprints.\\n\\nI knew well enough what they showed him, a wall which looked, in cross-section,\\nlike a sandwich. The entire wall was ten feet thick. The inner and outer\\n\\nsections were each about four feet thick. In the center was two feet of\\n\\npipe-space, and you want to believe that was the meat of the thing . . . in more\\nways than one.\\n\\nTremonts voice came out of the hole, sounding hollow and dead. \"Something\\nsmells awful in here, Warden.\"\\n\\n\"Never mind that! Keep going.\"\\n\\nTremonts lower legs disappeared into the hole. A moment later his feet were\\ngone, too. His light flashed dimly back and forth.\\n\\n\"Warden, it smells pretty damn bad.\"\\n\"Never mind, I said!\" Norton cried.\\n\\nDolorously, Tremonts voice floated back: \"Smells like shit. Oh God, thats what\\nit is, its shit, oh my God lemme outta here Im gonna blow my groceries oh \\nshit\\n\\nits shit oh my Gawwwwwd!\" And then came the unmistakable sound of Rory Tremont\\nlosing his last couple of meals.\\n\\n\\nWell, that was it for me. I couldnt help myself. The whole day, hell no, the\\nlast thirty years, all came up on me at once and I started laughing fit to\\n\\nsplit, a laugh such as Id never had since I was a free man, the kind of laugh I\\nnever expected to have inside these gray walls. And oh dear God didnt it feel\\ngood!\\n\\n\"Get that man out of here!\" Warden Norton was screaming, and I was laughing so\\nhard I didnt know if he meant me or Tremont. I just went on laughing and\\nkicking my feet and holding onto my belly. I couldnt have stopped if Norton had\\nthreatened to shoot me dead-bang on the spot. \"Get him OUT!\"\\n\\nWell, friends and neighbors, I was the one who went. Straight down to solitary,\\nand there I stayed for fifteen days. A long shot. But every now and then Id\\nthink about poor old not-too-bright Rory Tremont bellowing oh shit its shit,\\nand then Id think about Andy Dufresne heading south in his own car, dressed in\\na nice suit, and Id just have to laugh. I did that fifteen days in solitary\\npractically standing on my head. Maybe because half of me was with Andy\\n\\nDufresne, Andy Dufresne who had waded in shit and came out clean on the other\\nside, Andy Dufresne, headed for the Pacific.\\n\\nI heard the rest of what went on that night from half a dozen sources. There\\nwasnt all that much, anyway. I guess that Rory Tremont decided he didnt have\\nmuch left to lose after hed lost his lunch and dinner, because he did go on.\\n\\nThere was no danger of falling down the pipe-shaft between the inner and outer\\nsegments of the cellblock wall; it was so narrow that Tremont actually had to\\nwedge himself down. He said later that he could only take half-breaths and that\\nhe knew what it would be like to be buried alive.\\n\\nWhat he found at the bottom of the shaft was a master sewer-pipe which served\\nthe fourteen toilets in Cellblock 5, a porcelain pipe that had been laid\\n\\nthirty-three years before. It had been broken into. Beside the jagged hole in\\nthe pipe, Tremont found Andys rock-hammer.\\n\\nAndy had gotten free, but it hadnt been easy.\\n\\nThe pipe was even narrower than the shaft Tremont had just descended. Rory\\nTremont didnt go in, and so far as I know, no one else did, either. It must\\n\\nhave been damn near unspeakable. A rat jumped out of the pipe as Tremont was\\nexamining the hole and the rock-hammer, and he swore later that it was nearly as\\nbig as a cocker spaniel pup. He went back up the crawlspace to Andys cell like\\n\\na monkey on a stick.\\n\\nAndy had gone into that pipe. Maybe he knew that it emptied into a stream five\\nhundred yards beyond the prison on the marshy western side. I think he did. The\\n\\n\\nprison blueprints were around, and Andy would have found a way to look at them.\\nHe was a methodical cuss. He would have known or found out that the sewer-pipe\\nrunning out of Cellblock 5 was the last one in Shawshank not hooked into the new\\nwaste-treatment plant, and he would have known it was do it by mid- 197 5 or do\\n\\nit never, because in August they were going to switch us over to the new waste \\ntreatment\\nplant, too. Five hundred yards. The length of five football fields. Just shy of \\nhalf a mile. He\\ncrawled that distance, maybe with one of those small pen lights in his hand, \\nmaybe with\\nnothing but a couple of books of matches. He crawled through foulness that I \\neither cant\\nimagine or dont want to imagine. Maybe the rats scattered in front of him, or \\nmaybe they\\nwent for him the way such animals sometimes will when theyve had a chance to \\ngrow\\nbold   in the dark. He must have had just enough clearance at the shoulders to \\nkeep\\n\\nmoving, and he probably had to shove himself through the places where the \\nlengths of\\npipe were joined. If it had been me, the claustrophobia would have driven me \\nmad a dozen\\ntimes over. But he did it.\\n\\nAt the far end of the pipe they found a set of muddy footprints leading out of\\nthe sluggish, polluted creek the pipe fed into. Two miles from there a search\\nparty found his prison uniform. That was a day later.\\n\\nThree months after that memorable day, Warden Norton resigned. He was a broken\\nman, it gives me great pleasure to report. The spring was gone from his step. On\\nhis last day he shuffled act with his head down like an old con shuffling down\\n\\nto the infirmary for his codeine pills. It was Gonyar who took over, and to\\nNorton that must have seemed like the unkindest cut of all. For all I knee, Sam\\nNorton is down there in Eliot now, attending services at the Baptist church\\n\\nevery Sunday, and wondering how the hell Andy Dufresne ever could have gotten\\nthe better of him.\\n\\nI could have told him; the answer to the question is simplicity itself. Some\\nhave got it, Sam. And some dont, and never will.\\n\\n\\nXIII\\n\\nThats what I know; now Im going to tell you what I think I may have it wrong\\non some of the specifics, but Id be willing to let my watch and chain that Ive\\ngot the general outline down pretty well. Because, with Andy being the sort of\\n\\nman that he was, theres only one or two ways that it could have been. And every\\nnow ad then, when I think it out, I think of Normaden, that half-crazy Indian.\\n\"Nice Della,\" Normaden had said after celling with Andy for eight months. \"I was\\nglad to go, me. Bad draft in that cell. All the time cold. He dont let nobody\\ntouch his things. Thats okay. Nice man, never made fun. But big draft.\"\\n\\nPoor crazy Normaden. be knew more than all the rest of us, and he knew it \\nsooner. And\\nit was eight long months before Andy could get him out of there and have the\\n\\ncell to himself again. If it hadnt been for the eight months Normaden had spent\\nwith him after Warden Norton first came in. I do believe that Andy would have\\nbeen free before Nixon resigned.\\n\\nI believe now that it began in 1949, way back then - not with the rock-hammer, \\nbut\\nwith the Rita Hayworth poster.  I told you how nervous he seemed when he asked\\nfor that, nervous and filled with suppressed excitement.  At the time I thought\\n\\nit was just embarrassment, that Andy was the sort of guy whod never want\\nsomeone else to know that he had feet of clay and wanted a woman . . .\\nespecially       if it was a fantasy-woman.  But I think now that I was wrong. \\nI think\\nnow that Andys excitement came from something else altogether.\\n\\nWhat was responsible for the hole that Warden Norton eventually found behind the\\nposter of a girl that hadnt even been born when that photo of Rita Hayworth was\\ntaken?  Andy Dufresnes perseverance and hard work, yeah - I dont take any of \\nthat\\n\\n\\naway from him.  But there were two other elements in the equation: a lot of \\nluck,\\nand WPA concrete.\\n\\nYou dont need me to explain the luck, I guess. The WPA concrete I checked out\\nfor myself. I invested some time and a couple of stamps and wrote first to the\\nUniversity of Maine History Department and then to a fellow whose address they\\nwere able to give me. This fellow had been foreman of the WPA project that built\\nthe Shawshank Max Security Wing.\\n\\nThe wing, which contains Cellblocks 3, 4, and 5, was built in the years 1934-37.\\nNow, most people dont think of cement and concrete as \"technological\\ndevelopments,\" the way we think of cars and oil furnaces and rocket-ships, but\\nthey          really are. There was no modern cement until 1870 or so, and no \\nmodern\\nconcrete until after the turn of the century. Mixing concrete is as delicate a\\nbusiness    as making bread. You can get it too watery or not watery enough. You\\ncan get the sand-mix too thick or too thin, and the same is true of the\\n\\ngravel-mix. And back in 1934, the science of mixing the stuff was a lot less\\nsophisticated than it is today.\\n\\nThe walls of Cellblock 5 were solid enough, but they werent exactly dry and\\ntoasty. As a matter or fact, they were and are pretty damned dank. After a long\\nwet spell they would sweat and sometimes even drip. Cracks had a way of\\nappearing, some an inch deep. They were routinely mortared over.\\n\\nNow here comes Andy Dufresne into Cellblock 5. Hes a man who graduated from the\\nUniversity of Maines school of business, but hes also a man who took two or\\n\\nthree geology courses along the E way. Geology had, in fact, become his chief\\nhobby. I imagine it appealed to his patient, meticulous nature. A\\n\\nten-thousand-year ice age here. A million years of mountain-building there.\\nPlates of bedrock grinding against each other deep under the earths skin over\\nthe millennia. Pressure. Andy told me once that all of geology is the study of\\npressure.\\n\\nAnd time, of course. He had time to study those walls.  Plenty of time. When \\nthe cell door\\nslams and the lights go out, theres nothing else to look at.\\n\\nFirst-timers usually have a hard time adjusting to the confinement of prison\\nlife. They get screw-fever. Sometimes they have to be hauled down to the\\ninfirmary and sedated a couple of times before they get on the beam. Its not\\n\\nunusual to hear some new member of our happy little family banging on the bars\\nof his cell and screaming to be let out . . . and before the cries have gone on\\n\\nfor long, the chant starts up along the cellblock: \"Fresh fish, hey little\\nfishie, fresh fish, fresh fish, got fresh fish today!\"\\n\\nAndy didnt flip out like that when he came to The Shank in 1948, but thats \\nnot\\n\\n\\nto say that he didnt feel many of the same things. He may have come close to\\nmadness; some do, and some go sailing right over the edge. Old life blown away\\nin     the wink of an eye, indeterminate nightmare stretching out ahead, a long\\nseason in hell.\\n\\nSo what did he do, I ask you? He searched almost desperately for something to\\ndivert his restless mind. Oh, there are all sorts of ways to divert yourself,\\n\\neven in prison; it seems like the human mind is full of an infinite number of\\npossibilities when it comes to diversion. I told you about the sculptor and his\\nThree Ages of Jesus. There were coin collectors who were always losing their\\ncollections to thieves, stamp collectors, one fellow who had postcards from\\nthirty-five different countries-and let me tell you, he would have turned out\\nyour lights if hed caught you diddling with his postcards.\\n\\nAndy got interested in rocks. And the walls of his cell.\\n\\nI think that his initial intention might have been to do no more than to carve\\nhis initials into the wall where the poster of Rita Hayworth would soon be\\nhanging. His initials, or maybe a few lines from some poem. Instead, what he\\nfound was that interestingly weak concrete. Maybe he started to carve his\\ninitials and a big chunk of the wall just fell out. I can see him, lying there\\n\\non his bunk, looking at that broken chunk of concrete, turning it over in his\\nhands. Never mind the wreck of your whole life, never mind that you got\\nrailroaded into this place by a whole trainload of bad luck. Lets forget all\\nthat and look at this piece of concrete.\\n\\nSome months further along he might have decided it would be fun to see how much\\nof that wall he could take out. But you cant just start digging into your wall\\n\\nand then, when the weekly inspection (or one of the surprise inspections that\\nare always turning up interesting caches of booze, drugs, dirty pictures, and\\nweapons) comes around, say to the guard: \"This? Just excavating a little hole in\\nmy   cell wall. Not to worry, my good man.\"\\n\\nNo, he couldnt have that. So he came to me and asked if I could get him a Rita\\nHayworth poster. Not a little one but a big one.\\n\\nAnd, of course, he had the rock-hammer. I remember thinking when I got him that\\ngadget back in 48 that it would take a man six hundred years to burrow through\\nthe wall with it. True enough. But Andy only had to go through half the wall-and\\neven with the soft concrete, it took him two rock-hammers and twenty-seven years\\nto do it.\\n\\nOf course he lost most of one of those years to Normaden, and he could only work\\nat night, preferably late at night, when almost everybody is asleep-including\\n\\nthe guards who work the night shift. But I suspect the thing which slowed him\\n\\n\\ndown the most was getting rid of the wall as he took it out. He could muffle the\\nsound of his work by wrapping the head of his hammer in rock-polishing cloths,\\nbut what to do with the pulverized concrete and the occasional chunks that came\\nout whole?\\n\\nI think he must have broken up the chunks into pebbles and . . .\\n\\nI remembered the Sunday after I had gotten him the rockhammer. I remember\\nwatching him walk across the exercise yard, his face puffy from his latest\\n\\ngo-round with the sisters. I saw him stoop, pick up a pebble . . . and it\\ndisappeared up his sleeve. That inside sleeve-pocket is an old prison trick. Up\\nyour sleeve or just inside the cuff of your pants. And I have another memory,\\n\\nvery strong but unfocused, maybe something I saw more than once. This memory is\\nof Andy Dufresne walking across the exercise yard on a hot summer day when the\\nair was utterly still. Still, yeah . . . except for the little breeze that\\n\\nseemed to be blowing sand around Andy Dufresnes feet. So maybe he had a couple\\nof cheaters in his pants below the knees. You loaded the cheaters up with fill\\n\\nand then just strolled around, your hands in your pockets, and when you felt\\nsafe and unobserved, you gave the pockets a little twitch. The pockets, of\\ncourse, are attached by string or strong thread to the cheaters. The fill goes\\n\\ncascading out of your pants legs as you walk. The World war II POWs who were\\ntrying to tunnel out used the dodge.\\n\\nThe years went past and Andy brought his wall out to the exercise yard cupful by\\ncupful. He played the game with administrator after administrator, and they\\nthought it was because he wanted to keep the library growing. I have no doubt\\nthat was part of it, but the main thing Andy wanted was to keep Cell 14 in\\nCellblock 5 a single occupancy.\\n\\nI doubt if he had any real plans or hopes of breaking out, at least not at\\n\\nfirst. He probably assumed the wall was ten feet of solid concrete, and that if\\nhe succeeded in boring all the way through it, hed come out thirty feet over\\nthe exercise yard. But like I say, I dont think he was worried overmuch about\\n\\nbreaking through. His assumption could have run this way: I m only making a foot\\nof progress every seven years or so; therefore, it would take me seventy years\\n\\nto break through; that would make me one hundred and one years old.\\n\\nHeres a second assumption I would have made, had I been Andy: that eventually I\\nwould be caught and get a lot of solitary time, not to mention a very large\\n\\nblack mark on my record. After all, there was the regular weekly inspection and\\na surprise toss-which usually came at night-every second week or so. He must\\nhave decided that things couldnt go on for long. sooner or later, some screw\\nwas going to peek behind Rita Hayworth just to make sure Andy didnt have a\\nsharpened spoon-handle or some marijuana reefers Scotch-taped to the wall.\\n\\n\\nAnd his response to that second assumption must have been To hell with it. Maybe\\nhe even made a game out of it. How far in can I get before they find out? \\nPrison\\n\\nis a goddam boring place, and the chance of being surprised by an unscheduled\\ninspection in the middle of the night while he had his poster unstuck probably\\nadded some spice to his life during the early years.\\n\\nAnd I do believe it would have been impossible for him to get away with it just\\non dumb luck. Not for twenty-seven years. Nevertheless, I have to believe that\\nfor the first two years- until mid-May of 1950, when he helped Byron Hadley get\\naround the tax on his windfall inheritance-thats exactly what he did get by \\non.\\n\\nOr maybe he had something more than dumb luck going for him even back then. He\\nhad money, and he might have been slipping someone a little squeeze every week\\n\\nto take it easy on him. Most guards will go along with that if the price is\\nright; its money in their pockets and the prisoner gets to keep his whack off\\npictures or his tailor made cigarettes. Also, Andy was a model prisoner- quiet,\\nwell-spoken, respectful, non-violent. Its the crazies and the stampeders that\\nget         their cells turned upside-down at least once every six months, their\\nmattresses unzipped, their pillows taken away and cut open, the outflow pipe\\nfrom their toilets carefully probed.\\n\\nThen, in 1950, Andy became something more than a model prisoner. In 1950, he\\nbecame a valuable commodity, a murderer who did tax-returns better than H&R\\nBlock. He gave gratis estate-planning advice, set up tax-shelters, filled out\\n\\nloan applications (sometimes creatively). I can remember him sitting behind his\\ndesk in the library, patiently going over a car-loan agreement paragraph by\\n\\nparagraph with a screwhead who wanted to buy a used DeSoto, telling the guy what\\nwas good about the agreement and what was bad about it, explaining to him that\\n\\nit was possible to shop for a loan and not get hit quite so bad, steering him\\naway from the finance companies, which in those days were sometimes little it\\nbetter than legal loan sharks. When he d finished, the screwhead started to put\\nout his hand . . . and then drew it back to himself quickly. He d forgotten for\\na moment, you see, that he was dealing with a mascot, not a man.\\n\\nAndy kept up on the tax laws and the changes in the stock markets and so his\\nusefulness didnt end after he d been in cold storage for awhile, as it might\\nhave done. He began to get his library money, his running war with the sisters\\nhad ended, and nobody tossed his cell very hard. He was a good nigger.\\n\\nThen one day, very late in the going-perhaps around October of 1967-the\\n\\nlong-time hobby suddenly turned into something else. One night while was in the\\nhole up to his waist with Raquel Welch hanging down over his ass, the pick end \\nof\\nhis rock-hammer must have suddenly sunk into concrete past the hilt.\\n\\nHe would have dragged some chunks of concrete back, but maybe he heard other\\nfalling down into that shaft, bouncing back and forth, clinking of that\\n\\n\\nstandpipe. Did he know by then that he was going to come upon that shaft, or was\\nhe totally surprised? I dont know. He might have seen the prison blueprints by\\nthen or he might not have. If not, you can be damned sure he found a way to look\\nat them not long after.\\n\\nAll at once he must have realized that, instead of just playing a game, he was\\nplaying for high stakes . . . in terms of his own life and his own future, tie\\nhighest. Even then he couldnt have known for sure, but he muss have had a\\npretty good idea because it was right around then that he talked to me about\\nZihuatanejo for the first time. All of a sudden, instead of just being a toy,\\n\\nthat stupid hole in the wall became his master-if he knew about the sewer-pipe\\nat the bottom and that it led under the outer wall, it did, anyway.\\n\\nHed had the key under the rock in Buxton to worry about for years. Now he had D\\nworry that some eager-beaver new guard would look behind his poster and expose\\nthe whole thing, or that he would get another cellmate, or that he would, after\\n\\nall those years, suddenly be transferred He had all those things on his mind for\\nthe next eight years. All Scan say is that he must have been one of the coolest\\nmen who ever lived. I would have gone completely nuts after awhile, living with\\nal that uncertainty. But Andy just went on playing the game.\\n\\nHe had to carry tie possibility of discovery for another eight years-the\\nprobability )f it, you might say, because no matter how carefully he stacked tie\\ncards    in his favor, as an inmate of a state prison, he just didnt have that\\n\\nmany to stack . . . and the gods had been kind to him for a very long time; some\\nnineteen years.\\n\\nThe most ghastly irony I can think of would have been if he had been offered a\\nparole. Can you imagine it? Three days before the parolee is actually released,\\nhe is transferred into the light security wing to undergo a complete physical\\nand a battery of vocational tests. While hes there, his old cell is completely\\ncleaned out. Instead of getting his parole, Andy would have gotten a long turn\\ndownstairs in solitary, followed by some more time upstairs . . . but in a\\ndifferent cell.\\n\\nIf he broke into the shaft in 1967, how come he didnt escape until 1975 ? I\\ndont know for sure-but I can advance some pretty good guesses.\\n\\nFirst, he would have become more careful than ever. He was too smart to just\\npush ahead at flank speed and try to get out in eight months, or even in\\neighteen. He must have gone on widening the opening on the crawlspace a little\\nat       a time. A hole as big as a teacup by the time he took his New Years \\nEve\\ndrink that year. A hole as big as a dinner-plate by the time he took his\\n\\nbirthday drink in 1968. As big as a serving-tray by the time the 1969 baseball\\nseason opened.\\n\\n\\nFor a time I thought it should have gone much faster than it apparently\\n\\ndid-after he broke through, I mean. It seemed to me that, instead of hating to\\npulverize the crap and take it out of his cell in the cheater gadgets I have\\ndescribed, he could simply let it drop down the shaft. The length of time he\\ntook makes me believe that he didnt dare do that. He might have decided that\\nthe noise would arouse someones suspicions. Or, if he knew about the\\n\\nsewer-pipe, as I believe he must have, he would have been afraid that a falling\\nchunk of concrete would break it before he was ready, screwing up the cellblock\\nsewage system and leading to an investigation. And an investigation, needless to\\nsay, would lead to ruin.\\n\\nStill and all, Id guess that, by the time Nixon was sworn in for his second\\n\\nterm, the hole would have been wide enough for him to wriggle through . . . and\\nprobably sooner than that. Andy was a small guy.\\n\\nWhy didnt he go then?\\n\\nThats where my educated guesses run out, folks; from this point they become\\nprogressively wilder. One possibility is that the crawlspace itself was clogged\\nwith crap and he had to clear it out. But that wouldnt account for all the\\ntime. So what was it?\\n\\nI think that maybe Andy got scared.\\n\\nIve told you as well as I can how it is to be an institutional man. At first\\n\\nyou cant stand those four walls, then you get so you can abide them, then you\\nget so you accept them . . . and then, as your body and your mind and your\\nspirit adjust to life on an HO scale, you get to love them. You are told when to\\neat, when you can write letters, when you can smoke. If youre at work in the\\nlaundry or the plate-shop, youre assigned five minutes of each hour when you\\ncan  go to the bathroom. For thirty-five years, my time was twenty-five minutes\\nafter the hour, and after thirty-five years, thats the only time I ever felt\\n\\nthe need to take a piss or have a crap: twenty-five minutes past the hour. And\\nif for some reason I couldnt go, the need would pass at thirty after, and come\\nback at twenty-five past the next hour.\\n\\nI think Andy may have been wrestling with that tiger-that institutional\\nsyndrome-and also with the bulking fears that all of it might have been for\\nnothing.\\n\\nHow many nights must he have lain awake under his poster, thinking about that\\nsewer line, knowing that the one chance was all hed ever get? The blueprints\\nmight have told him how big the pipes bore was, but a blueprint couldnt tell\\nhim what it would be like inside that pipe-if he would be able to breathe\\n\\nwithout choking, if the rats were big enough and mean enough to fight instead \\nof\\n\\n\\nretreating . . . and a blueprint couldntve told him what hed find at the end\\nof the pipe, when and if he got there. Heres a joke even funnier than the\\n\\nparole would have been: Andy breaks into the sewer line, crawls through five\\nhundred yards of choking, shit-smelling darkness, and comes up against a\\nheavy-gauge mesh screen at the end of it all. Ha, ha, very funny.\\n\\nThat would have been on his mind. And if the long shot actually came in and he\\nwas able to get out, would he be able to get some civilian clothes and get away\\nfrom the vicinity of the prison undetected? Last of all, suppose he got out of\\nthe pipe, got away from Shawshank before the alarm was raised, got to Buxton,\\noverturned the right rock. . . and found nothing beneath? Not necessarily\\nsomething      so dramatic as arriving at the right field and discovering that a\\nhighrise apartment building had been erected on the spot, or that it had been\\nturned into a supermarket parking lot.\\n\\nIt could have been that some little kid who liked rocks noticed that piece of\\nvolcanic glass, turned it over, saw the deposit-box key, and took both it and\\n\\nthe rock back to his room as souvenirs. Maybe a November hunter kicked the rock,\\nleft the key exposed, and a squirrel or a crow with a liking for bright shiny\\n\\nthings had taken it away. Maybe there had been spring floods one year, breaching\\nthe wall, washing the key away. Maybe anything.\\n\\nSo I think-wild guess or not-that Andy just froze in place for awhile. After\\nall, you cant lose if you dont bet. What did he have to lose, you ask? His\\nlibrary, for one thing. The poison peace of institutional life, for another. Any\\nfuture chance to grab his safe identity.\\n\\nBut he finally did it, just as I have told you. He tried . . . and, my! Didnt\\nhe succeed in spectacular fashion? You tell me!\\n\\nBut did he get away, you ask? What happened after? What happened when he got to\\nthat meadow and turned over that rock . . . always assuming the rock was still\\nthere? I cant describe that scene for you, because this institutional man is\\n\\nstill in this institution, and expects to be for years to come. But Ill tell\\n\\nyou this. Very late in the summer of 1975, on September 15th, to be exact, I \\ngot\\n\\na postcard which had been mailed from the tiny town of McNary, Texas. That town\\nis on the American side of the border, directly across from El Porvenir. The\\nmessage side of the card was totally blank. But I know. I know it in my heart as\\nsurely     as I know that were all going to die someday.\\n\\nMcNary was where he crossed. McNary, Texas.\\n\\nSo thats my story, Jack. I never believed how long it would take to write it\\nall down, or how many pages it would take. I started writing just after I got\\n\\nthat postcard, and here I am finishing up on January 14th, 1976. Ive used three\\npencils right down to knuckle-stubs, and a whole tablet of paper. Ive kept the\\n\\n\\npages carefully hidden. . . not that many could read my hen-tracks, anyway.\\nIt stirred up more memories than I ever would have believed. Writing about\\nyourself seems to be a lot like sticking a branch into clear river-water and\\nroiling up the muddy bottom.\\n\\nWell, you werent writing about yourself I hear someone in the peanut-gallery\\nsaying. You were writing about Andy Dufresne. Youre nothing but a minor\\ncharacter in your own story. But you know, thats just not so. Its all about\\n\\nme, every damned word of it. Andy was the part of me they could never lock up,\\nthe part of me that will rejoice when the gates finally open for me and I walk\\n\\nout in my cheap suit with my twenty dollars of mad-money in my pocket. That part\\nof me will rejoice no matter how old and broken and scared the rest of me is. I\\nguess its just that Andy had more of that part than me, and used it better.\\n\\nThere are others here like me, others who remember Andy. Were glad hes gone,\\nbut a little sad, too. Some birds are not meant to be caged, thats all. Their\\nfeathers are too bright, their songs too sweet and wild. So you let them go, or\\n\\nwhen you open the cage to feed them they somehow fly out past you. And the part\\nof you that knows it was wrong to imprison them in the first place rejoices, but\\nstill, the place where you live is that much more drab and empty for their\\ndeparture.\\n\\nThats the story and Im glad I told it, even if it is a bit inconclusive and\\n\\neven though some of the memories the pencil prodded up (like that branch poking\\nup the river-mud) made me feel a little sad and even older than I am. Thank you\\nfor listening. And Andy, if youre really down there, as I believe you are, \\nlook\\n\\nat the stars for me just after sunset, and touch the sand, and wade in the\\nwater, and feel free.\\n\\n\\nXIV\\n\\nI never expected to take up this narrative again, but here I am with the\\n\\ndog-eared, folded pages open on the desk in front of me. Here I am adding\\nanother three or four pages, writing in a brand-new tablet. A tablet I bought in\\na store-I just walked into a store on Portlands Congress Street and bought it.\\nI thought I had put finish to my story in a Shawshank prison cell on a bleak\\nJanuary day in 1976. Now its May of 1977 and I am sitting in a small, cheap\\nroom of the Brewster Hotel in Portland, adding to it.\\n\\nThe window is open, and the sound of the traffic floating in seem huge,\\nexciting, and intimidating. I have to look constantly over at the window and\\nreassure myself that there are no bars on it. I sleep poorly at night because\\n\\nthe bed in this room, as cheap as the room is, seems much too big and luxurious.\\nI snap awake every morning promptly at six-thirty, feeling disoriented and\\nfrightened. M) dreams are bad. I have a crazy feeling of free fall. The\\n\\nsensation is as terrifying as it is exhilarating.\\n\\nWhat has happened in my life? Cant you guess? I was paroled. After \\nthirty-eight\\n\\n\\nyears of routine hearings and routine denials (in the course of those\\n\\nthirty-eight years, three lawyers died on me), my parole was granted. I suppose\\nthey decided that, at the age of fifty-eight, I was finally used up enough to be\\ndeemed safe.\\n\\nI came very close to burning the document you have just read. They search\\noutgoing parolees almost as carefully as they search incoming \"new fish.\" And\\nbeyond containing enough dynamite to assure me of a quick turnaround and another\\nsix  or eight years inside, my \"memoirs\" contained something else: the name of\\n\\nthe town where I believe Andy Dufresne to be. Mexican police gladly cooperate\\nwith the American police, and I didnt want my freedom-or my unwillingness to\\ngive up the story Id worked so long and hard to write-to cost Andy his.\\n\\nThen I remembered how Andy had brought in his five hundred dollars back in 1948,\\nand I took out my story of him the same way. Just to be on the safe side, I\\n\\ncarefully rewrote each page which mentioned Zihuatanejo. If the papers had been\\nfound during my \"outside search,\" as they call it at The Shank, I would have\\ngone back in on turnaround . . . but the cops would have been looking for Andy\\nin   a Peruvian seacoast town named Las Intrudres.\\n\\nThe Parole Committee got me a job as a \"stock-room assistant\" at 310 the big\\nFoodWay Market at the Spruce Mall in South Portland - which means I became just\\none more aging bag-boy. Theres only two kinds of bag-boys, you know; the old\\nones and the young ones. No one ever looks at either kind. If you shop at the\\nSpruce Mall FoodWay, I may have even taken your groceries out to your car . . .\\nbut youd have had to have shopped there between March and April of 1977,\\nbecause thats as long as I worked there.\\n\\nAt first I didnt think I was going to be able to make it on the outside at \\nall.\\n\\nIve described prison society as a scaled-down model of your outside world, but\\n\\nI had no idea of how fast things moved on the outside; the raw speed people move\\nat. They even talk faster. And louder.\\n\\nIt was the toughest adjustment Ive ever had to make, and I havent finished\\nmaking it yet . . . not by a long way. Women, for instance. After hardly knowing\\nthat they were half of the human race for forty years, I was suddenly working in\\na store filled with them. Old women, pregnant women wearing tee-shirts with\\n\\narrows pointing downward and a printed motto reading BABY HERE, skinny women\\nwith their nipples poking out at their shirts-a woman wearing something like\\n\\nthat when I went in would have gotten arrested and then had a sanity\\nhearing-women of every shape and size. I found myself going around with a\\nsemi-hard almost all the time and cursing myself for being a dirty old man.\\n\\nGoing to the bathroom, that was another thing. When I had to go (and the urge\\nalways came on me at twenty-five past the hour), I had to fight the almost\\noverwhelming need to check it with my boss. Knowing that was something I could\\n\\n\\njust go and do in this too bright outside world was one thing; adjusting my\\ninner self to that knowledge after all those years of checking it with the\\nnearest screwhead or facing two days in solitary for the oversight . . . that\\nwas something else.\\n\\nMy boss didnt like me. He was a young guy, twenty-six or -seven, and I could\\nsee that I sort of disgusted him, the way a cringing, servile old dog that\\n\\ncrawls up to you on its belly to be petted will disgust a man. Christ, I\\ndisgusted myself. But . . . I couldnt make myself stop. I wanted to tell him:\\n\\nThats what a whole life in prison does for you, young man. It turns everyone in\\na position of authority into a master, and you into every masters dog. Maybe\\nyou know youve become a dog, even in prison, but since everyone else in gray is\\na dog, too, it doesnt seem to matter so much. Outside, it does. But I couldnt\\n\\ntell a young guy like him. He would never understand. Neither would my PO, a\\nbig, bluff ex-Navy man with a huge red beard and a large stock of Polish jokes.\\nHe saw me for about five minutes every week. \"Are you staying out of the bars,\\nRed?\" hed ask when hed run out of Polish jokes. Id say yeah, and that would\\nbe the end of it until next week.\\n\\nMusic on the radio. When I went in, the big bands were just getting up a good\\nhead of steam. Now every song sounds like its about fucking. So many cars. At\\nfirst I felt like I was taking my life into my hands every time I crossed the\\nstreet.\\n\\nThere was more-everything was strange and frightening-but maybe you get the\\nidea, or can at least grasp a corner of it. I began to think about doing\\n\\nsomething to get back in. When youre on parole, almost anything will serve. Im\\nashamed to say it, but I began to think about stealing some money or shoplifting\\nstuff from the FoodWay, anything, to get back in where it was quiet and you knew\\neverything that was going to come up in the course of the day.\\n\\nIf I had never known Andy, I probably would have done that. But I kept thinking\\nof him, spending all those years chipping patiently away at the cement with his\\nrock-hammer so he could be free. I thought of that and it made me ashamed and\\nId         drop the idea again. Oh, you can say he had more reason to be free \\nthan I\\n\\ndid- he had a new identity and a lot of money. But thats not really true, you\\nknow. Because he didnt know for sure that the new identity was still there, and\\nwithout the new identity, the money would always be out of reach. No, what he\\nneeded was just to be free, and if I kicked away what I had, it would be like\\nspitting in the face of everything he had worked so hard to win back.\\n\\nSo what I started to do on my time off was to hitchhike rides down to the little\\ntown of Buxton. This was in the early April of 1977, the snow just starting to\\nmelt off the fields, the air just beginning to be warm, the baseball teams\\n\\ncoming north to start a new season playing the only game Im sure God approves\\n\\n\\nof. When I went on these trips, I carried a Silva compass in my pocket.\\nTheres a big hay field in Buxton, Andy had said, and at the north end of that\\nhayfield theres a rock wall, right oat of a Robert Frost poem. And somewhere\\nalong the base of that wall is a rock that has no earthly business in a Maine\\nhayfield.\\n\\nA fools errand, you say. How many hayfields are there in a small rural town\\nlike Buxton? Fifty? A hundred? Speaking from personal experience, Id put it at\\neven higher than that, if you add in the fields now cultivated which might have\\nbeen haygrass when Andy went in. And if I did find the right one, I might never\\nknow it. Because I might overlook that black piece of volcanic glass, or, much\\nmore likely, Andy put it into his pocket and took it with him.\\n\\nSo Id agree with you. A fools errand, no doubt about it. Worse, a dangerous\\none for a man on parole, because some of those fields were clearly marked with\\n\\nNO TRESPASSING signs. And, as Ive said, theyre more than happy to slam your\\nass back inside if you get out of line. A fools errand . . . but so is \\nchipping\\n\\nat a blank concrete wall for twenty-seven years. And when youre no longer the\\nman who can get it for you and just an old bag-boy, its nice to have a hobby to\\ntake your mind off your new life. My hobby was looking for Andys rock.\\n\\nSo Id hitchhike to Buxton and walk the roads. Id listen to the birds, to the\\nspring runoff in the culverts, examine the bottles the retreating snows had\\nrevealed-all useless non-returnables, I am sorry to say; the world seems to have\\ngotten awfully spendthrift since I went into the slam-and looking for \\nhayfields.\\n\\nMost of them could be eliminated right off. No rock walls. Others had rock\\nwalls, but my compass told me they were facing the wrong direction. I walked\\nthese wrong ones anyway. It was a comfortable thing to be doing, and on those\\noutings I really felt free, at peace. An old dog walked with me one Saturday.\\n\\nAnd one day I saw a winter-skinny deer.\\n\\nThen came April 23rd, a day Ill not forget even if I live another fifty-eight\\nyears. It was a balmy Saturday afternoon, and I was walking up what a little \\nboy\\n\\nfishing from a bridge told me was called The Old Smith Road. I had taken a lunch\\nin a brown FoodWay bag, and had eaten it sitting on a rock by the road. When\\n\\nI was done I carefully buried my leavings, as my dad taught me before he died,\\nwhen I was a sprat no older than the fisherman who had named the road for me.\\nAround two oclock I came to a big field on my left. There was a stone wall at\\nthe    far end of it, running roughly northwest. I walked back to it, squelching\\nover the wet ground, and began to walk the wall. A squirrel scoffed me from an\\noak tree.\\n\\nThree-quarters of the way to the end, I saw the rock. No mistake. Black glass\\nand as smooth as silk. A rock with no earthly business in a Maine hayfield. For\\na long time I just looked at it, feeling that I might cry, for whatever reason.\\n\\n\\nThe squirrel had followed me, and it was still chattering away. My heart was\\nbeating madly.\\n\\nWhen I felt I had myself under control, I went to the rock, squatted beside\\nit-the joints in my knees went off like a double-barreled shotgun-and let my\\n\\nhand touch it. It was real. I didnt pick it up because I thought there would be\\nanything under it; I could just as easily have walked away without finding what\\nwas beneath. I certainly Clad no plans to take it away with me, because I didnt\\nfeel it was mine to take-I had a feeling that taking that rock from the field\\nwould have been the worst kind of theft. No, I only picked it up to feel it\\nbetter, to get the heft of the thing, and, I suppose, to prove its reality by\\nfeeling its satiny texture against my skin.\\n\\nI had to look at what was underneath for a long time. My eyes saw it, but it\\ntook awhile for my mind to catch up. It was an envelope, carefully wrapped in a\\nplastic bag to keep away the damp. My name was written across the front in\\nAndys clear script.\\n\\nI took the envelope and left the rock where Andy had left it, and Andys friend\\nbefore him.\\n\\nDear Red,\\n\\nIf youre reading this, then youre out. One way or another, youre out. And f\\nyouve followed along this far, you might be willing to come a little further.\\n\\nI think you remember the name of the town, dont you? I could use a good man\\nto help me get my project on wheels. Meantime, have a drink on me-and do think\\nit over. I will be keeping an eye out for you. Remember that hope is a good\\nthing, Red, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. I will be\\nhoping that this letter finds you, and finds you well.\\n\\nYour friend,\\nPeter Stevens\\n\\nI didnt read that letter in the field. A kind of terror had come over me, a\\nneed to get away from there before I was seen. To make what may be an\\nappropriate pun, I was in terror of being apprehended.\\n\\nI went back to my room and read it there, with the smell of old mens dinners\\ndrifting up the stairwell to me-Beefaroni, RiceaRoni, NoodleRoni. You can bet\\nthat whatever the old folks of America, the ones on fixed incomes, are eating\\ntonight, it almost certainly ends in “roni.”\\n\\nI opened the envelope and read the letter and then I put my head in my arms and\\ncried. With the letter there were twenty new fifty dollar bills.\\n\\n\\nAnd here I am in the Brewster Hotel, technically a fugitive from justice\\n\\nagain-parole violation is my crime. No ones going to throw up any roadblocks to\\ncatch a criminal wanted on that charge, I guess-wondering what I should do now.\\nI have this manuscript. I have a small piece of luggage about the size of a\\ndoctors bag that holds everything I own. I have nineteen fifties, four tens, a\\n\\nfive, three ones, and assorted change. I broke one of the fifties to buy this\\ntablet of paper and a deck of smokes.\\n\\nWondering what I should do.\\n\\nBut theres really no question. It always comes down to just two choices. Get\\nbusy living or get busy dying.\\n\\nFirst Im going to put this manuscript back in my bag. Then Im going to buckle\\nit up, grab my coat, go downstairs, and check out of this fleabag. Then Im\\ngoing to walk uptown to a bar and put that five-dollar bill down in front of the\\nbartender and ask him to bring me two straight shots of Jack Daniels-one for me\\nand  one for Andy Dufresne. Other than a beer or two, theyll be the first \\ndrinks\\nIve taken as a free man since 1938. Then I am going to tip the bartender a\\n\\ndollar and thank him kindly. I will leave the bar and walk up Spring Street to\\n\\nthe Greyhound terminal there and buy a bus ticket to El Paso by way of New York\\nCity. When I get to El Paso, Im going to buy a ticket to McNary. And when I get\\nto McNary, I guess Ill have a chance to find out if an old crook like me can\\n\\nfind a way to float across the border and into Mexico.\\n\\nSure I remember the name. Zihuatanejo. A name like that is just too pretty to\\nforget.\\n\\nI find I am excited, so excited I can hardly hold the pencil in my trembling\\nhand. I think it is the excitement that only a free man can feel, a free man\\nstarting a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain.\\n\\nI hope Andy is down there.\\n\\nI hope I can make it across the border.\\n\\nI hope to see my friend and shake his hand.\\n\\nI hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams.\\nI hope.\\n\\nThe End\\n\\n\\n'"
